*Power in Every Symbol â€” Every Operator, Understood and Tamed*

-----

Welcome to Chapter 4, where we delve into the fundamental building blocks of all Python programs: **operators** and **expressions**. In Chapter 3, we explored data types and how variables reference objects in memory. Now, we'll learn how to actually *do* things with those objectsâ€”how to combine them, transform them, and make decisions based on them.

An uncompromising programmer doesn't just know what an operator does; they understand *how* it works, its subtleties, and how it fits into Python's expression-oriented design. Mastering operators is key to writing concise, efficient, and truly Pythonic code.

-----

### **1. Expressions vs. Statements: The Foundational Difference**

Before we dissect individual operators, it's crucial to understand the two core types of constructs in any programming language: **expressions** and **statements**. For the uncompromising programmer, this distinction isn't mere academic jargon; it dictates how code behaves and what you can do with it.

#### **What is an Expression? What Does It Return?**

At its heart, an **expression** in Python is a piece of code that, when evaluated by the interpreter, **produces (or returns) a value**. Think of it as a calculation or a question that yields an answer.

  * **Key Characteristic:** Every expression evaluates to a single, specific object (a value).
  * **Examples:**
      * `10` (evaluates to the integer object `10`)
      * `"hello"` (evaluates to the string object `"hello"`)
      * `5 + 3` (evaluates to the integer object `8`)
      * `len("Python")` (evaluates to the integer object `6`)
      * `x > 0` (evaluates to a boolean object `True` or `False`)
      * `my_list[0]` (evaluates to the object at index 0 of `my_list`)

You can use an expression wherever a value is expected. For example, the argument to a function call, the right-hand side of an assignment, or within a conditional check.

```python
# Simple expressions and their returned values
result_int = 10 * 2         # Expression `10 * 2` returns 20
print(result_int)           # 20

result_str = "Python" + "ic" # Expression `"Python" + "ic"` returns "Pythonic"
print(result_str)           # Pythonic

is_positive = -5 < 0        # Expression `-5 < 0` returns True
print(is_positive)          # True

# An expression as an argument to a function
print(max(10, 20, 5))       # The expression `max(10, 20, 5)` returns 20

# An expression as part of a larger expression
final_score = (80 + 90) / 2 # `(80 + 90)` is an expression, `/ 2` is an expression
print(final_score)          # 85.0
```

#### **What is a Statement?**

A **statement**, in contrast to an expression, is a unit of code that performs an **action** or executes a **command**. It does *not* necessarily evaluate to a value that can be assigned or used in another expression. Statements represent a complete instruction.

  * **Key Characteristic:** Executes an action; often doesn't "return" a value in the same sense an expression does (though some statements, like assignment, *do* have side effects and can sometimes be part of an expression as we'll see with the Walrus operator).
  * **Examples:**
      * `x = 10` (an assignment statement)
      * `print("Hello")` (a print statement, though `print` is a function call which *is* an expression, the whole line as an instruction is a statement)
      * `if condition: ...` (a conditional statement)
      * `for item in my_list: ...` (a loop statement)
      * `def my_function(): ...` (a function definition statement)
      * `import os` (an import statement)

<!-- end list -->

```python
# Examples of statements
x = 10                  # Assignment statement
print("Hello, world!")  # Function call (expression) wrapped in a statement
if x > 5:               # If statement
    print("x is greater than 5")
```

*The uncompromising programmer distinguishes expressions from statements. Expressions are about **producing values**; statements are about **performing actions**.* You cannot assign a statement to a variable (e.g., `y = if x > 0:` would be a syntax error).

#### **Pythonâ€™s Expression-Oriented Design**

Python leans heavily towards an **expression-oriented design**. This means that many constructs that might be statements in other languages are expressions in Python, making the language more flexible and often leading to more concise code.

Key aspects of this design include:

  * Most operations (arithmetic, comparison, logical) result in a value.
  * Function calls are always expressions.
  * Even conditional logic can be an expression (the ternary operator `x if condition else y`).
  * List comprehensions, dictionary comprehensions, and generator expressions are powerful examples of combining expressions.

This design philosophy encourages functional programming patterns and allows for compact, readable code where results from one operation can seamlessly feed into the next.

#### **`eval()` and Its Dangers**

The `eval()` function in Python takes a string as an argument and attempts to **evaluate that string as a Python expression**. It then returns the result of that evaluation.

```python
code_string_1 = "2 * (10 + 5)"
result_1 = eval(code_string_1)
print(f"eval('{code_string_1}') = {result_1}") # Output: 30

code_string_2 = "len('Uncompromising')"
result_2 = eval(code_string_2)
print(f"eval('{code_string_2}') = {result_2}") # Output: 14
```

**The Uncompromising Warning: Dangers of `eval()`**

While `eval()` seems powerful, it is an incredibly dangerous function in most real-world applications.

  * **Security Risk:** `eval()` can execute *any* valid Python expression. If you use `eval()` on input received from an untrusted source (like user input on a web form, data from an external file, or a network request), you are essentially allowing that external source to execute arbitrary Python code on your system. This is a massive security vulnerability.
    ```python
    # NEVER do this with untrusted input!
    malicious_input = "__import__('os').system('rm -rf /')" # Example: delete all files
    # eval(malicious_input) # This line could cause severe damage if run!
    print("Pretending to run malicious code via eval()... (NOT ACTUALLY RUNNING)")
    ```
  * **Readability & Maintainability:** Code that relies heavily on `eval()` is typically harder to read, debug, and maintain because the logic is hidden within strings and only determined at runtime.

*The uncompromising programmer understands that `eval()` is almost always a sign of a design flaw when used with untrusted input. There are almost always safer, more explicit ways to achieve desired functionality (e.g., using configuration files, parsing specific commands, or dedicated libraries). Reserve `eval()` for very specific, controlled scenarios where the input source is guaranteed to be trusted and the expressions are well-defined.*

#### **Nesting Expressions**

A key aspect of writing powerful and concise Python code is the ability to **nest expressions**. This means using the result of one expression as an input or component of another, larger expression.

```python
# Simple nesting
total_cost = (item_price * quantity) + shipping_fee
# (item_price * quantity) is an expression
# Its result is used in the `+ shipping_fee` expression

# Nesting function calls
greeting = "Hello, " + input("Enter your name: ").strip().capitalize() + "!"
# `input()` is an expression that returns a string.
# `.strip()` is a method call (expression) on that string, returning a new string.
# `.capitalize()` is another method call (expression) on the result of .strip().
# The result of .capitalize() is then used in string concatenation.
print(greeting)

# Nesting comparisons within a larger expression
is_valid_range = (user_age >= 18) and (user_age <= 65)
# `user_age >= 18` is an expression returning a boolean.
# `user_age <= 65` is an expression returning a boolean.
# These boolean results are then combined by the `and` logical operator (another expression).
```

Nesting allows you to build complex logic from simpler parts, following Python's philosophy of readable and composable code. However, over-nesting can reduce readability, so use parentheses to clarify intent where needed.

### **2. Arithmetic Operators: The Foundation of Computation**

Arithmetic operators are the symbols used to perform mathematical calculations. While seemingly straightforward, an uncompromising programmer understands their nuances in Python, especially how they interact with different numerical types and handle edge cases.

#### **Basic Usage: The Core Operations**

Python provides standard arithmetic operators for common mathematical tasks:

| Operator | Operation       | Example          | Result |
| :------- | :-------------- | :--------------- | :----- |
| `+`      | Addition        | `10 + 3`         | `13`   |
| `-`      | Subtraction     | `10 - 3`         | `7`    |
| `*`      | Multiplication  | `10 * 3`         | `30`   |
| `/`      | Division        | `10 / 3`         | `3.333...` |
| `//`     | Floor Division  | `10 // 3`        | `3`    |
| `%`      | Modulus (Remainder) | `10 % 3`       | `1`    |
| `**`     | Exponentiation  | `2 ** 3`         | `8`    |

```python
# Basic Arithmetic Examples
print(f"10 + 3 = {10 + 3}")
print(f"10 - 3 = {10 - 3}")
print(f"10 * 3 = {10 * 3}")
print(f"2 ** 3 = {2 ** 3}") # 2 to the power of 3 (2*2*2)
print(f"9 ** 0.5 = {9 ** 0.5}") # Square root (3.0)

# Operations with floats
print(f"5.0 + 2.5 = {5.0 + 2.5}") # Result is float
print(f"7 * 1.5 = {7 * 1.5}")   # Result is float
```

#### **Differences Between `/` (True Division), `//` (Floor Division), and `%` (Modulus)**

These three operators are often confused but are distinct and powerful for integer arithmetic.

1.  **`/` (True Division):**

      * Always returns a `float` result, even if the numbers divide evenly.
      * This is a significant difference from many other languages (like C++ or Java) where integer division (`/`) truncates. Python's `/` provides "true" mathematical division.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```python
    print(f"10 / 3 = {10 / 3}")    # Output: 3.3333333333333335
    print(f"9 / 3 = {9 / 3}")      # Output: 3.0 (still a float!)
    print(f"-10 / 3 = {-10 / 3}")  # Output: -3.3333333333333335
    ```

2.  **`//` (Floor Division):**

      * Performs division and then "floors" the result, meaning it rounds down to the nearest whole number (integer).
      * The result type will be `int` if both operands are integers, and `float` if either operand is a float.
      * **Crucial for negative numbers:** Floor division always rounds *down* towards negative infinity.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```python
    print(f"10 // 3 = {10 // 3}")   # Output: 3 (3.33... rounded down)
    print(f"9 // 3 = {9 // 3}")     # Output: 3
    print(f"10 // 3.0 = {10 // 3.0}") # Output: 3.0 (result is float because of 3.0)
    print(f"-10 // 3 = {-10 // 3}") # Output: -4 (important! -3.33... rounded down to -4, not -3)
    print(f"-7 // 2 = {-7 // 2}")   # Output: -4 (-3.5 rounded down to -4)
    ```

3.  **`%` (Modulus - Remainder):**

      * Returns the remainder of the division.
      * The sign of the result matches the sign of the *divisor*.
      * The relationship `a = (a // b) * b + (a % b)` always holds true.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```python
    print(f"10 % 3 = {10 % 3}")    # Output: 1 (10 = 3*3 + 1)
    print(f"9 % 3 = {9 % 3}")      # Output: 0
    print(f"10 % -3 = {10 % -3}")  # Output: -2 (10 = -4 * -3 + (-2)) -> Sign of divisor (-3)
    print(f"-10 % 3 = {-10 % 3}")  # Output: 2 (-10 = -4 * 3 + 2) -> Sign of divisor (3)
    print(f"-7 % 2 = {-7 % 2}")    # Output: 1 (-7 = -4 * 2 + 1)
    ```

    *The uncompromising programmer understands the precise behavior of floor division and modulus with negative numbers, as this is a common source of bugs for those coming from other languages.*

#### **Float Quirks and the `decimal` Module Intro**

Floating-point numbers (`float` type) are represented in computers using a binary (base-2) system. This can lead to small, seemingly "quirky" inaccuracies when representing decimal (base-10) numbers that don't have an exact binary equivalent (similar to how $1/3$ cannot be perfectly represented in decimal).

```python
print(f"0.1 + 0.2 = {0.1 + 0.2}") # Output: 0.30000000000000004 (not exactly 0.3)
print(f"1.1 - 0.2 = {1.1 - 0.2}") # Output: 0.9000000000000001
```

These small errors are typically negligible for most scientific or graphical applications. However, for **financial calculations, exact decimal arithmetic, or critical precision requirements**, these quirks are unacceptable.

**The Uncompromising Solution: The `decimal` Module**

For scenarios demanding absolute decimal precision, Python provides the built-in `decimal` module. This module implements decimal floating-point arithmetic using base 10, avoiding the binary representation issues.

```python
from decimal import Decimal, getcontext

# Set precision for decimal calculations (default is usually 28)
getcontext().prec = 6 # Example: set to 6 decimal places

d1 = Decimal('0.1') # Always create Decimal objects from strings for exact representation
d2 = Decimal('0.2')
d3 = Decimal('0.3')

print(f"Decimal 0.1 + 0.2 = {d1 + d2}") # Output: 0.3
print(f"Decimal 1.1 - 0.2 = {Decimal('1.1') - Decimal('0.2')}") # Output: 0.9

# Comparison with Decimal is also exact
print(f"Decimal 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3: {d1 + d2 == d3}") # Output: True (Exact!)

# Be aware of context precision
d4 = Decimal('1') / Decimal('3')
print(f"Decimal 1/3 (prec=6) = {d4}") # Output: 0.333333 (truncated to 6 places)

getcontext().prec = 28 # Reset to default or higher for more precision
d4 = Decimal('1') / Decimal('3')
print(f"Decimal 1/3 (prec=28) = {d4}") # Output: 0.3333333333333333333333333333
```

*The uncompromising programmer never uses standard `float` for financial calculations or any domain where exact decimal representation is paramount. They reach for the `decimal` module.*

#### **Edge Case Demos**

  * **Division by Zero:** All division operators (`/`, `//`, `%`) will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` if the divisor is zero. This is a crucial runtime error that must be handled.

    ```python
    try:
        result = 10 / 0
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}") # Output: Error: division by zero

    try:
        result = 10 // 0
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}") # Output: Error: integer division or modulo by zero
    ```

  * **Zero to the Power of Zero (`0**0`):** In mathematics, this is often undefined or context-dependent (sometimes 1). In Python, `0 ** 0` evaluates to `1`.

    ```python
    print(f"0 ** 0 = {0 ** 0}") # Output: 1
    ```

#### **`divmod()` and `round()` Functions**

Python provides built-in functions that often offer more convenient or precise ways to handle common arithmetic needs.

1.  **`divmod(a, b)`:**

      * Returns a tuple containing the quotient (`a // b`) and the remainder (`a % b`).
      * This is more efficient than calculating `//` and `%` separately if you need both.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```python
    quotient, remainder = divmod(17, 5)
    print(f"divmod(17, 5) -> Quotient: {quotient}, Remainder: {remainder}") # Output: Quotient: 3, Remainder: 2

    # Works with negative numbers respecting floor division rules
    q_neg, r_neg = divmod(-17, 5)
    print(f"divmod(-17, 5) -> Quotient: {q_neg}, Remainder: {r_neg}") # Output: Quotient: -4, Remainder: 3
    # Check: (-4 * 5) + 3 = -20 + 3 = -17 (correct)
    ```

2.  **`round(number, ndigits=None)`:**

      * Rounds `number` to `ndigits` decimal places.
      * If `ndigits` is omitted or `None`, it rounds to the nearest integer.
      * **Important Rounding Rule (Tie-breaking):** When a number is exactly halfway between two integers (e.g., `2.5`, `3.5`), Python's `round()` uses "round half to even" (also known as "banker's rounding"). This means it rounds to the nearest even integer. This helps mitigate bias when summing rounded numbers.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```python
    print(f"round(3.14159, 2) = {round(3.14159, 2)}") # Output: 3.14
    print(f"round(7.8) = {round(7.8)}")             # Output: 8
    print(f"round(7.3) = {round(7.3)}")             # Output: 7

    # Banker's Rounding examples:
    print(f"round(2.5) = {round(2.5)}")             # Output: 2 (rounds to the nearest even integer)
    print(f"round(3.5) = {round(3.5)}")             # Output: 4 (rounds to the nearest even integer)
    print(f"round(2.6) = {round(2.6)}")             # Output: 3
    print(f"round(2.4) = {round(2.4)}")             # Output: 2
    ```

    *The uncompromising programmer is aware of the "round half to even" rule for `round()` and will use the `decimal` module's `quantize` method with specific rounding modes (e.g., `ROUND_HALF_UP`) if different rounding behavior is strictly required.*

### **3. Assignment Operators: Binding Names to Values**

Assignment is the most fundamental operation in Python: it's how you bind a name (a variable) to an object (a value) in memory. While the simple `=` operator is used for direct assignment, Python also provides a rich set of **compound assignment operators** and powerful shorthand for simultaneous assignments. An uncompromising programmer understands not just how to assign, but the profound implications of assignment on object references and mutability.

#### **Basic Assignment (`=`)**

The single equal sign is the basic assignment operator. It takes the object on its right-hand side and binds it to the variable name on its left-hand side.

```python
# Basic assignment
my_score = 100
player_name = "Alice"
is_game_over = False

print(f"my_score: {my_score}")
print(f"player_name: {player_name}")
print(f"is_game_over: {is_game_over}")
```

#### **Compound Assignment Operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, etc.)**

Compound assignment operators combine an arithmetic (or bitwise) operation with assignment. They provide a concise shorthand for modifying a variable's value based on its current value.

| Operator | Equivalent to        | Example (Initial `x = 10`) | Result of `x` |
| :------- | :------------------- | :-------------------------- | :------------ |
| `+=`     | `x = x + value`      | `x += 5`                    | `15`          |
| `-=`     | `x = x - value`      | `x -= 3`                    | `7`           |
| `*=`     | `x = x * value`      | `x *= 2`                    | `20`          |
| `/=`     | `x = x / value`      | `x /= 4`                    | `2.5`         |
| `//=`    | `x = x // value`     | `x //= 3`                   | `3`           |
| `%=`     | `x = x % value`      | `x %= 3`                    | `1`           |
| `**=`    | `x = x ** value`     | `x **= 2`                   | `100`         |
| `&=`     | `x = x & value`      | `x &= 0b11` (for bitwise)   | `2` (if x=10) |
| `|=`     | `x = x | value`      | `x |= 0b1` (for bitwise)    | `11` (if x=10)|
| `^=`     | `x = x ^ value`      | `x ^= 0b10` (for bitwise)   | `8` (if x=10) |
| `<<=`    | `x = x << value`     | `x <<= 1` (for bitwise)     | `20` (if x=10)|
| `>>=`    | `x = x >> value`     | `x >>= 1` (for bitwise)     | `5` (if x=10) |

```python
score = 50
score += 10 # score = score + 10 -> 60
print(f"score after += 10: {score}")

price = 20.0
price *= 1.05 # price = price * 1.05 -> 21.0
print(f"price after *= 1.05: {price}")

progress = 17
progress %= 5 # progress = progress % 5 -> 2
print(f"progress after %= 5: {progress}")

# Example with string (concatenation)
message = "Hello"
message += " World!" # message = message + " World!" -> "Hello World!"
print(f"message after += ' World!': {message}")

# Example with list (extension)
my_numbers = [1, 2]
my_numbers += [3, 4] # my_numbers = my_numbers + [3, 4] -> [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(f"my_numbers after += [3, 4]: {my_numbers}")
```

#### **Difference Between Reassignment and In-Place Mutation with Compound Assignments**

This is a critical distinction for the uncompromising programmer, directly tied to the concepts of **mutability** and **object identity** from Chapter 3.

  * **Reassignment:** For **immutable** types (like `int`, `float`, `str`, `tuple`), compound assignment operators behave exactly like `x = x op value`. A *new object* is created for the result of the operation, and the variable name is then **rebound** to this new object. The original object, if no longer referenced, becomes eligible for garbage collection.

    ```python
    x = 10
    id_x_initial = id(x)
    print(f"x: {x}, id(x): {id_x_initial}")

    x += 5 # Equivalent to x = x + 5. A new int object 15 is created.
           # The name 'x' is rebound to this new object.
    id_x_after = id(x)
    print(f"x: {x}, id(x): {id_x_after}")
    print(f"Did x's ID change? {id_x_initial != id_x_after}") # Output: True (usually)
    ```

    (Note: For small integers, Python often "interns" them, meaning `id()` might unexpectedly stay the same for `x += 1`. This is an optimization. The conceptual model of a new object being created still holds, and for larger numbers or floats, the `id` *will* change.)

  * **In-Place Mutation:** For **mutable** types (like `list`, `dict`, `set`), compound assignment operators often (but not always\!) attempt to perform an **in-place modification** of the original object, if the type supports it. This means the object's `id()` typically remains the same, as its content is updated directly.

    ```python
    my_list = [1, 2, 3]
    id_list_initial = id(my_list)
    print(f"my_list: {my_list}, id(my_list): {id_list_initial}")

    my_list += [4, 5] # This typically calls my_list.extend([4, 5]), which modifies the list in-place.
    id_list_after = id(my_list)
    print(f"my_list: {my_list}, id(my_list): {id_list_after}")
    print(f"Did my_list's ID change? {id_list_initial != id_list_after}") # Output: False (most common case for lists)

    # Contrast with explicit reassignment for lists:
    another_list = [10, 20]
    id_another_initial = id(another_list)
    print(f"another_list: {another_list}, id(another_list): {id_another_initial}")
    another_list = another_list + [30, 40] # This explicitly creates a *new* list object.
    id_another_after = id(another_list)
    print(f"another_list: {another_list}, id(another_list): {id_another_after}")
    print(f"Did another_list's ID change? {id_another_initial != id_another_after}") # Output: True
    ```

    *The uncompromising programmer leverages compound assignments for mutable types when in-place modification is desired, as it's often more efficient (avoids creating a new object) and semantically clear.* Always be aware of whether the operation will rebind the name or mutate the object.

#### **Chaining Assignments: `a = b = c = 0`**

Python allows you to assign the same value to multiple variables in a single line using chained assignment. This is evaluated from right to left.

```python
x = y = z = 0
print(f"x: {x}, y: {y}, z: {z}") # Output: x: 0, y: 0, z: 0

# All three variables now reference the *same* integer object (0)
print(f"id(x): {id(x)}, id(y): {id(y)}, id(z): {id(z)}")
print(f"x is y: {x is y}, y is z: {y is z}") # Output: True, True
```

**Crucial Caveat for Chained Assignment with Mutable Objects:**

While chaining is fine for immutable objects, be extremely cautious when chaining assignments of **mutable objects**. All variables will point to the *exact same mutable object*. Modifying one through any of the variables will affect all of them.

```python
list1 = list2 = list3 = [1, 2, 3] # ALL refer to the same list object!

print(f"list1: {list1}, id(list1): {id(list1)}")
print(f"list2: {list2}, id(list2): {id(list2)}")

list1.append(4) # Modify the list via list1

print(f"list1 after append: {list1}") # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(f"list2 after append: {list2}") # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4] (SURPRISE! It changed too!)

print(f"list1 is list2: {list1 is list2}") # Output: True
```

*The uncompromising programmer avoids chaining assignment for mutable objects unless the explicit intention is to create aliases that share and modify the same underlying object.* If you need independent mutable objects, create them separately: `list1 = [1,2,3]; list2 = [1,2,3]`.

#### **Variable Value Swap: `a, b = b, a`**

Python offers an incredibly elegant and Pythonic way to swap the values of two variables without needing a temporary variable. This is achieved through **tuple packing and unpacking** in a single assignment statement.

```python
a = 10
b = 20

print(f"Before swap: a = {a}, b = {b}")

a, b = b, a # The magic swap!
            # 1. Right side: (b, a) creates a temporary tuple (20, 10).
            # 2. Left side: This tuple is unpacked into 'a' and 'b'.
            #    'a' gets 20, 'b' gets 10.

print(f"After swap: a = {a}, b = {b}") # Output: After swap: a = 20, b = 10
```

This pattern is widely used and highly readable. It relies on the right-hand side creating a tuple (implicitly or explicitly), which is then unpacked into the variables on the left-hand side.

*The uncompromising programmer leverages Python's expressive assignment features, like compound assignments for concise modifications and tuple unpacking for elegant swaps, always mindful of the underlying object model and mutability implications.*

### **4. Comparison Operators: Making Decisions with Data**

Comparison operators, also known as relational operators, are fundamental for controlling program flow and making decisions. They allow you to compare two values and determine their relationship, always returning a Boolean result (`True` or `False`). For the uncompromising programmer, understanding their precise behavior, especially across different data types and in advanced scenarios like chaining, is non-negotiable.

#### **Basic Comparison Operators**

Python provides a standard set of comparison operators:

| Operator | Meaning                  | Example          | Result   |
| :------- | :----------------------- | :--------------- | :------- |
| `==`     | Equal to                 | `5 == 5`         | `True`   |
| `!=`     | Not equal to             | `5 != 10`        | `True`   |
| `>`      | Greater than             | `10 > 5`         | `True`   |
| `<`      | Less than                | `5 < 10`         | `True`   |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to | `10 >= 10`       | `True`   |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to    | `5 <= 10`        | `True`   |

```python
# Numerical comparisons
print(f"5 == 5: {5 == 5}")       # True
print(f"5 != 10: {5 != 10}")     # True
print(f"10 > 5: {10 > 5}")       # True
print(f"5 < 10: {5 < 10}")       # True
print(f"10 >= 10: {10 >= 10}")   # True
print(f"5 <= 10: {5 <= 10}")     # True

# String comparisons (lexicographical/dictionary order)
# Case matters ('A' < 'a')
print(f"'apple' == 'apple': {'apple' == 'apple'}") # True
print(f"'apple' != 'orange': {'apple' != 'orange'}") # True
print(f"'apple' < 'orange': {'apple' < 'orange'}") # True (a comes before o)
print(f"'Banana' < 'apple': {'Banana' < 'apple'}") # True (B comes before a due to ASCII values)

# Mixed type comparisons (generally discouraged for ==/!= unless types have defined conversions)
# Python 3 generally prevents direct comparison of totally unrelated types with <, >, etc.
# print(5 < "hello") # TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'int' and 'str'
print(f"5 == 5.0: {5 == 5.0}") # True (Python performs implicit type promotion for comparison)
```

*The uncompromising programmer is precise with numerical comparisons and understands that string comparisons are based on lexicographical (dictionary) order, influenced by character encoding (e.g., ASCII or Unicode) values, meaning 'A' comes before 'a'. They also know that Python's strong typing prevents direct order comparisons between fundamentally unrelated types (like `int` and `str`), raising a `TypeError`.*

#### **Use with Custom Classes (`__eq__`, `__lt__`, etc.)**

By default, for custom objects (objects you create from your own `class` definitions, as briefly introduced in Chapter 3.6), the `==` operator checks for **identity** (like `is`) unless you explicitly define how your objects should be compared. Other comparison operators (`<`, `>`, etc.) will raise a `TypeError` by default.

To enable meaningful comparisons for your custom objects, you implement special "dunder" (double underscore) methods within your class definition. This process is called **operator overloading**, which we'll cover in more detail in Section 4.12.

Here's a preview for comparison operators:

  * `__eq__(self, other)`: Implements the `==` operator.
  * `__ne__(self, other)`: Implements the `!=` operator.
  * `__lt__(self, other)`: Implements the `<` operator.
  * `__le__(self, other)`: Implements the `<=` operator.
  * `__gt__(self, other)`: Implements the `>` operator.
  * `__ge__(self, other)`: Implements the `>=` operator.

<!-- end list -->

```python
# Let's use a simple class to demonstrate (will be fully explained in 4.12)
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    # Define how Point objects are compared for equality (==)
    def __eq__(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, Point): # Ensure 'other' is also a Point object
            return NotImplemented # Or raise TypeError
        return self.x == other.x and self.y == other.y

    # Define how Point objects are compared for less than (<)
    def __lt__(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, Point):
            return NotImplemented
        # Example: compare based on x-coordinate, then y if x's are equal
        return (self.x, self.y) < (other.x, other.y)

    def __repr__(self): # For better printing of the object
        return f"Point({self.x}, {self.y})"

p1 = Point(1, 2)
p2 = Point(1, 2)
p3 = Point(3, 4)
p4 = Point(1, 3)

print(f"p1 == p2: {p1 == p2}") # True (because __eq__ is implemented)
print(f"p1 == p3: {p1 == p3}") # False
print(f"p1 != p3: {p1 != p3}") # True

print(f"p1 < p3: {p1 < p3}")   # True (because __lt__ is implemented, (1,2) < (3,4))
print(f"p1 < p4: {p1 < p4}")   # True (because __lt__ is implemented, (1,2) < (1,3))
print(f"p4 < p1: {p4 < p1}")   # False

# Default behavior without __eq__ or __lt__
class SimpleObject:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

s1 = SimpleObject(10)
s2 = SimpleObject(10)
print(f"s1 == s2 (without __eq__): {s1 == s2}") # False (default checks identity)
# print(f"s1 < s2 (without __lt__): {s1 < s2}") # TypeError (no __lt__ defined)
```

*The uncompromising programmer defines appropriate comparison methods for custom classes to ensure logical and predictable behavior for equality and ordering, reflecting the domain's rules.*

#### **Chaining Comparisons (`1 < x <= 10`)**

One of Python's most elegant features is the ability to **chain comparison operators**. This allows you to express multiple comparisons concisely, much like in mathematics.

The expression `a < b < c` is not evaluated as `(a < b) < c`. Instead, it is logically equivalent to `(a < b) and (b < c)`, but it's more efficient as `b` is evaluated only once.

```python
age = 25

# Chained comparison: (age > 18) and (age < 65)
is_working_age = 18 < age < 65
print(f"Is {age} working age (18 < age < 65)? {is_working_age}") # True

temperature = 0

# Chained comparison: (temperature >= -5) and (temperature <= 5)
is_freezing_ish = -5 <= temperature <= 5
print(f"Is {temperature} around freezing (-5 <= temp <= 5)? {is_freezing_ish}") # True

# An example where chaining might not be what you expect if misunderstood
x = 10
y = 5
z = 10

# Is x equal to y AND y equal to z? No, because y is 5, not 10.
# This evaluates as (x == y) and (y == z)
print(f"x == y == z: {x == y == z}") # False

# Example of a common pitfall:
a = False
b = 0
c = ""
# If you expect this to check if 'a' is equal to 'b' AND 'b' is equal to 'c'
# This works for these Falsy values
print(f"False == 0 == '': {False == 0 == ''}") # True (False==0 is True, 0=='' is False, True and False is False) - Wait!

# Let's break down False == 0 == ''
# 1. False == 0 --> True
# 2. 0 == '' --> False
# 3. True and False --> False
# So, the output will be False. My previous comment about "True" for this specific chain was incorrect for the last comparison.
# This actually highlights a good point of potential confusion in chaining == with different types that can implicitly convert for ==

# Let's clarify that specific example:
# False == 0 evaluates to True
# 0 == '' evaluates to False
# The chain False == 0 == '' is effectively (False == 0) and (0 == '')
# Which is (True) and (False) --> False.
# This correctly demonstrates that while Python allows chaining, you still need to understand the individual comparisons.
# In this specific case, 0 == '' is False because an integer 0 and an empty string "" are not considered equal by Python's ==.
# My prior comment was implicitly thinking of 'truthiness' which is for `bool()` or `if` conditions, not `==`.

# Re-demonstrating:
print(f"False == 0: {False == 0}") # True
print(f"0 == '': {0 == ''}")     # False
print(f"False == 0 == '': {False == 0 == ''}") # Effectively (False == 0) and (0 == '') which is (True and False) = False.
```

*The uncompromising programmer harnesses chained comparisons for concise, mathematical expressions, but always validates their understanding of how individual comparisons resolve, especially when different types are involved, to avoid subtle bugs.*

### **5. Logical Operators: Crafting Conditional Logic**

Logical operators are indispensable tools for building complex conditions and controlling the flow of your program. They allow you to combine or negate Boolean expressions (`True` or `False`). An uncompromising programmer not only knows what `and`, `or`, and `not` do but deeply understands their short-circuiting behavior and how they can be cleverly used beyond simple Boolean results.

#### **`and`, `or`, `not` with Truth Tables**

Python's logical operators operate on Boolean values (`True` or `False`). However, they also leverage Python's concept of "truthiness" and "falsiness" (introduced in Chapter 3.5), meaning they can evaluate *any* object.

1.  **`and` Operator:**

      * Returns `True` if **both** operands are `True`.
      * Returns `False` if **either** or **both** operands are `False`.

    | Operand 1 | Operand 2 | `Operand 1 and Operand 2` |
    | :-------- | :-------- | :------------------------ |
    | `True`    | `True`    | `True`                    |
    | `True`    | `False`   | `False`                   |
    | `False`   | `True`    | `False`                   |
    | `False`   | `False`   | `False`                   |

    ```python
    print(f"True and True: {True and True}")      # True
    print(f"True and False: {True and False}")    # False
    print(f"False and True: {False and True}")    # False
    print(f"False and False: {False and False}")  # False

    # With truthy/falsy values
    print(f"10 and 'hello': {10 and 'hello'}") # Output: 'hello' (both truthy, returns second)
    print(f"0 and 'world': {0 and 'world'}")   # Output: 0 (first is falsy, returns first)
    print(f"'Python' and []: {'Python' and []}") # Output: [] (second is falsy, returns second)
    ```

2.  **`or` Operator:**

      * Returns `True` if **either** or **both** operands are `True`.
      * Returns `False` only if **both** operands are `False`.

    | Operand 1 | Operand 2 | `Operand 1 or Operand 2` |
    | :-------- | :-------- | :----------------------- |
    | `True`    | `True`    | `True`                   |
    | `True`    | `False`   | `True`                   |
    | `False`   | `True`    | `True`                   |
    | `False`   | `False`   | `False`                  |

    ```python
    print(f"True or True: {True or True}")      # True
    print(f"True or False: {True or False}")    # True
    print(f"False or True: {False or True}")    # True
    print(f"False or False: {False or False}")  # False

    # With truthy/falsy values
    print(f"10 or 'hello': {10 or 'hello'}") # Output: 10 (first is truthy, returns first)
    print(f"0 or 'world': {0 or 'world'}")   # Output: 'world' (first is falsy, returns second)
    print(f"'Python' or []: {'Python' or []}") # Output: 'Python' (first is truthy, returns first)
    ```

3.  **`not` Operator:**

      * A unary operator (takes one operand).
      * Inverts the Boolean value of the operand. `not True` is `False`, `not False` is `True`.

    | Operand | `not Operand` |
    | :------ | :------------ |
    | `True`  | `False`       |
    | `False` | `True`        |

    ```python
    print(f"not True: {not True}")       # False
    print(f"not False: {not False}")     # True

    # With truthy/falsy values
    print(f"not 0: {not 0}")             # True (0 is falsy, not 0 is True)
    print(f"not 10: {not 10}")           # False (10 is truthy, not 10 is False)
    print(f"not '': {not ''}")           # True (empty string is falsy, not '' is True)
    print(f"not 'hello': {not 'hello'}") # False ('hello' is truthy, not 'hello' is False)
    ```

    *The uncompromising programmer understands that `and` and `or` don't always return `True` or `False`. They return one of the operands themselves, depending on their truthiness/falsiness. `not` always returns a strict `True` or `False`.*

#### **Short-Circuiting in Detail**

A critical performance and logic feature of Python's `and` and `or` operators is **short-circuiting**. This means the second operand is *not* evaluated if the result of the expression can be determined solely from the first operand.

  * **`and` Short-Circuiting:** If the first operand of an `and` expression evaluates to `False` (or a falsy value), the entire expression is immediately known to be `False`. Python stops evaluation there and returns the *first operand*.

      * **Trace Visual:**
        ```
        result = A and B
        # If A is False (or falsy):
        #   result is A. B is never evaluated.
        # If A is True (or truthy):
        #   B is evaluated. result is B.
        ```
      * **Example:**
        ```python
        def risky_operation():
            print("Risky operation executed!")
            # This could, for example, access a network, divide by zero, etc.
            return True

        x = 0 # Falsy value
        # The 'risky_operation()' is NOT called because 'x' is falsy.
        # The expression short-circuits.
        outcome = x and risky_operation()
        print(f"Outcome: {outcome}")
        # Output:
        # Outcome: 0

        y = 10 # Truthy value
        # 'risky_operation()' IS called because 'y' is truthy.
        outcome = y and risky_operation()
        print(f"Outcome: {outcome}")
        # Output:
        # Risky operation executed!
        # Outcome: True
        ```

  * **`or` Short-Circuiting:** If the first operand of an `or` expression evaluates to `True` (or a truthy value), the entire expression is immediately known to be `True`. Python stops evaluation there and returns the *first operand*.

      * **Trace Visual:**
        ```
        result = A or B
        # If A is True (or truthy):
        #   result is A. B is never evaluated.
        # If A is False (or falsy):
        #   B is evaluated. result is B.
        ```
      * **Example:**
        ```python
        def default_value():
            print("Default value generator executed!")
            return "DEFAULT"

        user_input = "" # Falsy value
        # 'default_value()' IS called because 'user_input' is falsy.
        # The expression does not short-circuit on the first operand.
        choice = user_input or default_value()
        print(f"Choice: {choice}")
        # Output:
        # Default value generator executed!
        # Choice: DEFAULT

        user_input_valid = "User Defined Value" # Truthy value
        # 'default_value()' is NOT called because 'user_input_valid' is truthy.
        # The expression short-circuits.
        choice_valid = user_input_valid or default_value()
        print(f"Choice (valid): {choice_valid}")
        # Output:
        # Choice (valid): User Defined Value
        ```

    *The uncompromising programmer leverages short-circuiting for both efficiency and robust logic, often to avoid unnecessary computations or potential errors by strategically placing conditions that prevent the evaluation of risky expressions.*

#### **Using Logical Operators for Defaulting Values (The `or` Trick)**

The short-circuiting behavior of the `or` operator is frequently used as a concise and Pythonic way to provide default values when an initial variable might be empty, `None`, or otherwise falsy.

```python
# Common Pattern: config = user_input or default

user_name = input("Enter your name (optional): ") # User types nothing (empty string)
display_name = user_name or "Guest" # If user_name is falsy (empty string), use "Guest"
print(f"Hello, {display_name}!")

user_name_entered = "Alice"
display_name_entered = user_name_entered or "Guest"
print(f"Hello, {display_name_entered}!")

# Example with a function call as default
def get_default_config():
    print("Generating default config...")
    return {"theme": "light", "notifications": True}

user_config = {} # Falsy (empty dictionary)
app_config = user_config or get_default_config()
print(f"App config: {app_config}")

user_config_provided = {"theme": "dark"} # Truthy
app_config_provided = user_config_provided or get_default_config()
print(f"App config (provided): {app_config_provided}")
```

**Caveat for the Uncompromising Programmer:**

While elegant, this `or` trick has a subtle pitfall: it treats *any* falsy value (0, `False`, `None`, `""`, `[]`, `{}`) as needing a default. If `0` or `False` is a legitimate, desired input value that should *not* be replaced by a default, then this pattern is inappropriate. In such cases, use an explicit `if` statement or the ternary operator:

```python
# Problem: We want score 0 to be valid, but 'or' treats it as default.
user_score_input = 0 # Valid score, but falsy
actual_score_wrong = user_score_input or 100 # This will make actual_score_wrong = 100
print(f"Wrong score handling (0 treated as default): {actual_score_wrong}")

# Correct way: Explicitly check for None or specific invalid states
user_score_input_none = None # Or could be user_score_input = 0
final_score_correct = user_score_input_none if user_score_input_none is not None else 100
print(f"Correct score handling (None treated as default): {final_score_correct}")

# Or even better, an explicit if check:
if user_score_input_none is None:
    final_score_correct_if = 100
else:
    final_score_correct_if = user_score_input_none
print(f"Correct score handling (if statement): {final_score_correct_if}")
```

*The uncompromising programmer chooses the `or` defaulting trick for concise code only when `False`, `0`, `""`, `[]`, etc., are truly considered "empty" or "undesired" and should be replaced. Otherwise, they use more explicit conditional checks to avoid surprising behavior.*

### **6. Bitwise Operators: Operating on the Raw Bits**

Bitwise operators manipulate the individual binary digits (bits) of integer numbers. While often overlooked in high-level programming, mastering them provides unparalleled control over data representation and unlocks powerful, efficient solutions in specific problem domains. Thus specifically here we will be more detailed.

To truly understand these operators, we must visualize numbers not just as decimals, but as sequences of `0`s and `1`s.

#### **Refresher: Binary Numbers and Two's Complement**

  * **Binary (Base-2):** Our everyday numbers are base-10. Binary numbers use only two digits: 0 and 1. Each position represents a power of 2.
      * `0b101` (binary) = `1 * 2^2 + 0 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0` = `4 + 0 + 1 = 5` (decimal)
  * **Python's `bin()`:** Use `bin()` to see the binary representation of an integer (e.g., `bin(5)` returns `'0b101'`).
  * **Two's Complement for Negative Numbers:** Python integers are signed. Like most computer systems, Python uses **two's complement** to represent negative integers. This is crucial for understanding `~` (Bitwise NOT) and `>>` (Right Shift) with negative numbers.
      * **How to get -X's two's complement:** Invert all bits of `X`'s binary representation, then add 1.
      * **How to interpret a negative two's complement number:** If the leftmost bit is 1, it's negative. To find its magnitude, invert all its bits, then add 1.
      * Example for a conceptual 8-bit system:
          * `5` (decimal) = `0000 0101` (binary)
          * `~5` (Bitwise NOT `5`):
            1.  Invert all bits of `0000 0101` -\> `1111 1010` (This is the one's complement)
            2.  In two's complement, `1111 1010` is interpreted as `-6`. (Verify: invert `1111 1010` -\> `0000 0101`, add 1 -\> `0000 0110`, which is 6. So the original was `-6`).
            3.  This is why `~x` always results in `-(x + 1)`.

-----

#### **The Bitwise Operators: Explained with Practical Examples and Step-by-Step Binary**

For clarity, we'll often use a simplified conceptual 8-bit representation for our binary examples, but remember Python integers have arbitrary precision and can grow much larger.

-----

##### **1. `&` (Bitwise AND)**

  * **Definition:** Compares each bit position between two integers. If *both* corresponding bits are `1`, the result bit is `1`. Otherwise, the result bit is `0`.

  * **Truth Table:** `1 & 1 = 1`, otherwise `0`.

  * **Practical Use Case: Checking Permissions/Flags**
    Imagine a system where user permissions are stored as a single integer, where each bit represents a specific right.

      * `READ_PERMISSION = 0b001` (Bit 0)
      * `WRITE_PERMISSION = 0b010` (Bit 1)
      * `EXECUTE_PERMISSION = 0b100` (Bit 2)

    <!-- end list -->

    ```python
    user_flags = 0b101  # User has READ (bit 0) and EXECUTE (bit 2) permissions (Decimal 5)
    print(f"User flags (binary): {bin(user_flags)}")

    # Checking if the user has READ_PERMISSION
    print("\n--- Checking READ Permission ---")
    mask_read = 0b001
    has_read = (user_flags & mask_read) != 0 # (user_flags & mask_read) will be 0b001 (1) if READ is set, 0 (0b000) otherwise.
    print(f"Is READ_PERMISSION set? {has_read}")
    # Binary breakdown:
    #   user_flags: 0b101
    # & mask_read:  0b001
    # ----------
    #   Result:     0b001 (Decimal 1)
    # Since 1 is truthy, `(1) != 0` is True.

    # Checking if the user has WRITE_PERMISSION
    print("\n--- Checking WRITE Permission ---")
    mask_write = 0b010
    has_write = (user_flags & mask_write) != 0
    print(f"Is WRITE_PERMISSION set? {has_write}")
    # Binary breakdown:
    #   user_flags: 0b101
    # & mask_write: 0b010
    # ----------
    #   Result:     0b000 (Decimal 0)
    # Since 0 is falsy, `(0) != 0` is False.
    ```

  * **Why it works:** The `&` operator acts as a "filter" or "mask." By ANDing with a mask that has a `1` only at the bit position you care about, all other bits in the result will be `0`. If the targeted bit in the original number was `1`, the result will be non-zero (specifically, the mask value itself); otherwise, it will be `0`. This allows you to isolate and check the state of individual flags.

-----

##### **2. `|` (Bitwise OR)**

  * **Definition:** Compares each bit position between two integers. If *at least one* of the corresponding bits is `1`, the result bit is `1`. Otherwise, the result bit is `0`.

  * **Truth Table:** `0 | 0 = 0`, otherwise `1`.

  * **Practical Use Case: Setting Permissions/Flags**
    Continuing the permission example, use `|` to grant new permissions.

    ```python
    current_flags = 0b001 # User only has READ_PERMISSION (Decimal 1)
    print(f"Current flags (binary): {bin(current_flags)}")

    # Grant WRITE_PERMISSION to the user
    print("\n--- Granting WRITE Permission ---")
    WRITE_PERMISSION = 0b010
    updated_flags = current_flags | WRITE_PERMISSION
    print(f"Updated flags (binary): {bin(updated_flags)}") # Output: 0b11 (Decimal 3)
    # Binary breakdown:
    #   current_flags: 0b001
    # | WRITE_PERMISSION: 0b010
    # ----------------
    #   Result:          0b011 (Decimal 3)

    # Now, add EXECUTE_PERMISSION
    print("\n--- Granting EXECUTE Permission ---")
    EXECUTE_PERMISSION = 0b100
    final_flags = updated_flags | EXECUTE_PERMISSION
    print(f"Final flags (binary): {bin(final_flags)}") # Output: 0b111 (Decimal 7)
    # Binary breakdown:
    #   updated_flags:  0b011
    # | EXECUTE_PERMISSION: 0b100
    # -----------------
    #   Result:           0b111 (Decimal 7)
    ```

  * **Why it works:** The `|` operator acts as a "combiner." By ORing with a mask that has a `1` at the desired bit position, that bit in the result will be set to `1` (regardless of its original state), while other bits remain unchanged. This effectively "grants" or "adds" permissions/flags.

-----

##### **3. `^` (Bitwise XOR - Exclusive OR)**

  * **Definition:** Compares each bit position. If the corresponding bits are *different* (`0` and `1`, or `1` and `0`), the result bit is `1`. If they are the *same* (`0` and `0`, or `1` and `1`), the result bit is `0`.

  * **Truth Table:** `0 ^ 0 = 0`, `0 ^ 1 = 1`, `1 ^ 0 = 1`, `1 ^ 1 = 0`.

  * **Practical Use Case 1: Toggling Flags**
    XOR is perfect for flipping the state of a bit.

    ```python
    user_settings = 0b1010 # Assume bit 1 is 'Notifications Enabled', bit 3 is 'Dark Mode Enabled'
    NOTIFICATIONS_FLAG = 0b0010
    DARK_MODE_FLAG = 0b1000

    print(f"Initial settings: {bin(user_settings)}") # 0b1010

    # Toggle Notifications (currently enabled, bit 1 is 1)
    print("\n--- Toggling Notifications ---")
    user_settings = user_settings ^ NOTIFICATIONS_FLAG
    print(f"Settings after toggle 1: {bin(user_settings)}") # 0b1000 (Notifications now disabled)
    # Binary breakdown (bit 1 is 1 ^ 1 = 0, others unchanged):
    #   0b1010
    # ^ 0b0010
    # --------
    #   0b1000

    # Toggle Notifications again (currently disabled, bit 1 is 0)
    print("\n--- Toggling Notifications Again ---")
    user_settings = user_settings ^ NOTIFICATIONS_FLAG
    print(f"Settings after toggle 2: {bin(user_settings)}") # 0b1010 (Notifications now enabled again)
    # Binary breakdown (bit 1 is 0 ^ 1 = 1, others unchanged):
    #   0b1000
    # ^ 0b0010
    # --------
    #   0b1010
    ```

  * **Why it works:** The XOR operator has the property that `X ^ 1 = ~X` (flips X) and `X ^ 0 = X` (leaves X unchanged). So, XORing with a mask allows you to flip only the bits where the mask has a `1`.

  * **Practical Use Case 2: Swapping Two Numbers Without a Temporary Variable**
    This is a classic bitwise trick, often seen in interview questions. While `a, b = b, a` is Pythonic, XOR swap works in languages without tuple unpacking.

    ```python
    x = 10 # 0b1010
    y = 7  # 0b0111
    print(f"Before swap: x={x}, y={y}")

    x = x ^ y # Step 1: x now holds combined info
    # Binary: 0b1010 ^ 0b0111 = 0b1101 (Decimal 13)
    print(f"x after x ^ y: {x} ({bin(x)})")

    y = x ^ y # Step 2: y now gets original x's value
    # Binary: 0b1101 ^ 0b0111 = 0b1010 (Decimal 10) -> This is the original value of x!
    print(f"y after x ^ y: {y} ({bin(y)})")

    x = x ^ y # Step 3: x now gets original y's value
    # Binary: 0b1101 ^ 0b1010 = 0b0111 (Decimal 7) -> This is the original value of y!
    print(f"x after x ^ y: {x} ({bin(x)})")

    print(f"After XOR swap: x={x}, y={y}") # Output: x=7, y=10
    ```

  * **Why it works:** The trick relies on the properties: `A ^ B ^ B = A` and `A ^ 0 = A`.

    1.  `x = x ^ y`: `x` now holds bits where `x` and `y` differ.
    2.  `y = x ^ y`: This becomes `(old_x ^ old_y) ^ old_y`. Since `old_y ^ old_y = 0`, this simplifies to `old_x ^ 0 = old_x`. So, `y` effectively gets the original value of `x`.
    3.  `x = x ^ y`: This becomes `(old_x ^ old_y) ^ old_x`. Since `old_x ^ old_x = 0`, this simplifies to `old_y ^ 0 = old_y`. So, `x` effectively gets the original value of `y`.

-----

##### **4. `~` (Bitwise NOT / One's Complement)**

  * **Definition:** A unary operator that inverts every bit of its operand. `0`s become `1`s, and `1`s become `0`s.

  * **Mathematical Equivalence:** For any integer `x`, `~x` is equivalent to `-(x + 1)`.

  * **Practical Use Case: Creating an Inverse Mask for Clearing Bits**
    We used this in the earlier example to clear a specific bit.

    ```python
    data_byte = 0b10110110 # Example data (Decimal 182)
    print(f"Original data: {bin(data_byte)}")

    # We want to clear (set to 0) the 3rd bit (0-indexed, so 2^3 = 8, or 0b1000)
    CLEAR_BIT_MASK = 0b0001000 # Mask for the 3rd bit (Decimal 8)

    # To clear the bit, we AND with a mask that has 0 at the target bit and 1s everywhere else.
    # We can get this by NOTing our clear bit mask.
    inverse_mask = ~CLEAR_BIT_MASK
    print(f"CLEAR_BIT_MASK: {bin(CLEAR_BIT_MASK)}")
    print(f"Inverse mask:   {bin(inverse_mask)}") # Notice the leading ones for negative numbers

    # Apply the inverse mask
    result = data_byte & inverse_mask
    print(f"Result (binary): {bin(result)}") # Output: 0b10100110 (Decimal 166)
    # Binary breakdown (conceptually, for a positive value interpretation):
    #   Original data:  10110110
    # & Inverse Mask:   11110111 (This is ~00001000, assuming fixed bits for visualization)
    # ------------------
    #   Result:         10100110 (Bit 3 is now 0)

    # Let's verify with simpler numbers
    num = 5   # 0b101
    not_num = ~num
    print(f"~{num} = {not_num}") # Output: ~5 = -6
    # Why?
    # 1. 5 in binary (conceptually): ...00000101
    # 2. Invert all bits:             ...11111010 (This is the two's complement representation of -6)
    # 3. Python interprets this two's complement value as -6.
    ```

  * **Why it works:** `~` is the one's complement. When used with `&`, `X & (~M)` effectively clears the bits in `X` where `M` has a `1`, because `M & (~M)` will be all `0`s. For its direct numerical result, the two's complement system makes `~x` equal to `-(x+1)`.

-----

##### **5. `<<` (Left Shift)**

  * **Definition:** Shifts the bits of the left operand to the left by `n` positions. `n` new `0` bits are introduced on the right side.

  * **Mathematical Equivalence:** `x << n` is equivalent to $x \\times 2^n$.

  * **Practical Use Case: Fast Multiplication by Powers of 2**
    When multiplying by 2, 4, 8, 16, etc., left shifting is extremely efficient.

    ```python
    value = 7 # 0b0111
    print(f"Original value: {value} ({bin(value)})")

    # Multiply by 2 (shift left by 1)
    result_mul_2 = value << 1
    print(f"Value << 1: {result_mul_2} ({bin(result_mul_2)})") # Output: 14 (0b1110)
    # Binary breakdown:
    # Original:  0b0111
    # Shift << 1: 0b1110 (a zero is added to the right)
    # 1 * 8 + 1 * 4 + 1 * 2 + 0 * 1 = 8 + 4 + 2 = 14

    # Multiply by 8 (shift left by 3, since 8 = 2^3)
    result_mul_8 = value << 3
    print(f"Value << 3: {result_mul_8} ({bin(result_mul_8)})") # Output: 56 (0b111000)
    # Binary breakdown:
    # Original:  0b0111
    # Shift << 3: 0b111000 (three zeros added to the right)
    # 1 * 32 + 1 * 16 + 1 * 8 = 32 + 16 + 8 = 56
    ```

  * **Why it works:** In any base-B number system, multiplying by B shifts all digits one position to the left and adds a zero. Since binary is base-2, shifting left by one position is equivalent to multiplying by 2. Shifting by `n` positions is multiplying by `2^n`.

-----

##### **6. `>>` (Right Shift)**

  * **Definition:** Shifts the bits of the left operand to the right by `n` positions.

  * **Mathematical Equivalence:** `x >> n` is equivalent to `x // (2**n)` (floor division).

  * **Crucial Detail: Arithmetic Right Shift (Python's behavior for signed integers)**
    When shifting right, new bits need to be filled on the left.

      * **Logical Right Shift (for unsigned):** Fills with `0`s on the left.
      * **Arithmetic Right Shift (Python's default for signed integers):** Fills with the value of the *original sign bit* (0 for positive, 1 for negative). This preserves the sign of the number, making it consistent with floor division.

  * **Practical Use Case: Fast Integer Division by Powers of 2**

    ```python
    value_pos = 14 # 0b1110
    print(f"Original positive value: {value_pos} ({bin(value_pos)})")

    # Divide by 2 (shift right by 1)
    result_div_2 = value_pos >> 1
    print(f"Positive Value >> 1: {result_div_2} ({bin(result_div_2)})") # Output: 7 (0b111)
    # Binary breakdown:
    # Original:  0b1110
    # Shift >> 1: 0b0111 (a zero is added to the left to preserve magnitude)
    # 0 * 8 + 1 * 4 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 1 = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7

    value_neg = -14 # Conceptually: ...11110010 (Two's Complement)
    print(f"Original negative value: {value_neg} ({bin(value_neg)})")

    # Divide by 2 (shift right by 1)
    result_neg_div_2 = value_neg >> 1
    print(f"Negative Value >> 1: {result_neg_div_2} ({bin(result_neg_div_2)})") # Output: -7 (0b...11111001)
    # Binary breakdown (Conceptual 8-bit for clarity, Python uses arbitrary precision):
    # Original: -14 is 1111 0010
    # Shift >> 1 (Arithmetic Shift, extend sign bit '1'): 1111 1001
    # Interpret 1111 1001 (two's complement):
    # 1. It's negative (leading 1).
    # 2. Invert: 0000 0110
    # 3. Add 1: 0000 0111 (which is 7).
    # So, 1111 1001 represents -7. This matches floor division: -14 // 2 = -7.
    ```

  * **Why it works:** Shifting right by `n` positions is equivalent to integer division by `2^n`. The arithmetic right shift is crucial for negative numbers because it ensures the result correctly corresponds to Python's floor division behavior, rounding towards negative infinity.

-----

#### **Why and When to Use Bitwise Operators**

  * **Memory Efficiency:** Packing multiple boolean flags into a single integer saves memory, which can be critical in very large data structures or embedded systems.
  * **Performance Optimization:** For operations involving multiplication or division by powers of two, bit shifts are often faster at the hardware level than generic arithmetic operations. While Python's high-level nature sometimes masks this, it can still be relevant in performance-critical loops.
  * **Atomic Operations:** Reading, setting, or clearing flags in a single bitwise operation can be atomic on certain architectures, which is important in concurrent programming to prevent race conditions (though Python's GIL often simplifies this for single-process concurrency).
  * **Low-Level System Interaction:** Essential for programming device drivers, manipulating hardware registers, or processing data from network protocols where information is tightly packed into bits and bytes.
  * **Specific Algorithms:**
      * **Hashing/Checksums:** Many algorithms rely on bitwise rotations, shifts, and XORs to mix data thoroughly.
      * **Graphics:** Manipulating individual color components within a pixel (e.g., RGB values packed into an integer).
      * **Error Detection/Correction:** Simple parity checks or more complex ECC (Error-Correcting Code) schemes use XOR.
      * **Competitive Programming:** Bitwise tricks are common for optimizing algorithms involving subsets, combinations, or graph traversals.

*The uncompromising programmer understands that bitwise operators are not a daily tool for most applications, but when the problem domain touches on low-level data representation, extreme performance, or specific algorithms, they become indispensable. They demystify their behavior by always thinking in terms of bits and two's complement.*

### **7. Membership Operators: Checking for Presence**

Membership operators are used to test whether a value or variable is found in a sequence (like a string, list, or tuple) or a collection (like a set or dictionary). They are highly intuitive and produce a Boolean result (`True` or `False`). For the uncompromising programmer, knowing how these operators work internally, and their performance characteristics across different data structures, is key to writing efficient and robust code.

#### **The Operators: `in` and `not in`**

1.  **`in` Operator:**

      * Returns `True` if the specified value is found in the sequence/collection.
      * Returns `False` otherwise.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```python
    my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
    print(f"30 in my_list: {30 in my_list}")   # Output: True
    print(f"99 in my_list: {99 in my_list}")   # Output: False

    my_string = "Hello Python"
    print(f"'Python' in my_string: {'Python' in my_string}") # Output: True
    print(f"'Java' in my_string: {'Java' in my_string}")     # Output: False
    print(f"'ell' in my_string: {'ell' in my_string}")       # Output: True (substring search)

    my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b')
    print(f"'a' in my_tuple: {'a' in my_tuple}") # Output: True

    my_set = {100, 200, 300}
    print(f"200 in my_set: {200 in my_set}")   # Output: True

    my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
    # For dictionaries, 'in' checks for keys
    print(f"'age' in my_dict: {'age' in my_dict}")     # Output: True
    print(f"'Alice' in my_dict: {'Alice' in my_dict}") # Output: False (checks keys, not values)
    print(f"30 in my_dict.values(): {30 in my_dict.values()}") # To check values, use .values()
    ```

2.  **`not in` Operator:**

      * Returns `True` if the specified value is *not* found in the sequence/collection.
      * Returns `False` otherwise. It's simply the negation of `in`.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```python
    my_list = [10, 20, 30]
    print(f"40 not in my_list: {40 not in my_list}") # Output: True
    print(f"20 not in my_list: {20 not in my_list}") # Output: False

    my_string = "apple"
    print(f"'z' not in my_string: {'z' not in my_string}") # Output: True
    ```

#### **How They Translate: `x in y` $\\rightarrow$ `y.__contains__(x)`**

Python's object model (Chapter 3) dictates that operators are essentially syntactic sugar for special "dunder" methods. The `in` operator is no exception. When you write `x in y`, Python internally attempts to call the `y.__contains__(x)` method.

This understanding is crucial for:

1.  **Custom Classes:** If you want your custom objects to support the `in` operator (e.g., if you create a custom collection type), you must implement the `__contains__` method.
2.  **Performance Implications:** The efficiency of the `in` operator depends entirely on how the `__contains__` method is implemented for the specific data type.

Let's look at how built-in types implement `__contains__` conceptually:

  * **Lists (`list`):** The `__contains__` method iterates through the list elements, comparing each one to the target value until a match is found or the end of the list is reached.
      * **Performance:** $O(N)$ - linear time. In the worst case, it has to check every element.
  * **Strings (`str`):** The `__contains__` method performs a substring search. This is optimized in C-level implementations but is still fundamentally a linear search.
      * **Performance:** $O(M \\times N)$ in naive worst case, but optimized algorithms (like Boyer-Moore, Rabin-Karp) make it faster in practice, closer to $O(N+M)$ where N is text length, M is pattern length.
  * **Tuples (`tuple`):** Similar to lists, it iterates through elements.
      * **Performance:** $O(N)$ - linear time.
  * **Sets (`set`):** Sets are implemented using hash tables. The `__contains__` method calculates the hash of the target value and directly checks if an entry exists at that hash location.
      * **Performance:** $O(1)$ - constant time on average, making it extremely fast for membership checks. This is a primary reason to use sets when frequent membership testing is required.
  * **Dictionaries (`dict`):** The `__contains__` method for dictionaries checks if a key is present. It also uses hash tables.
      * **Performance:** $O(1)$ - constant time on average for key lookups.

<!-- end list -->

```python
# Custom class demonstrating __contains__
class MyCustomCollection:
    def __init__(self, elements):
        self._elements = elements # Internal list for simplicity

    def __contains__(self, item):
        print(f"__contains__ called for '{item}' in MyCustomCollection")
        return item in self._elements # Delegate to list's in operator

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"MyCustomCollection({self._elements})"

my_collection = MyCustomCollection([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

print(f"3 in my_collection: {3 in my_collection}")
# Output:
# __contains__ called for '3' in MyCustomCollection
# 3 in my_collection: True

print(f"10 in my_collection: {10 in my_collection}")
# Output:
# __contains__ called for '10' in MyCustomCollection
# 10 in my_collection: False
```

*The uncompromising programmer considers the Big O notation performance of `in` for different data structures. They know that `set` and `dict` offer average $O(1)$ lookup, making them ideal for high-frequency membership checks, whereas `list` and `tuple` are $O(N)$.*

#### **Pitfall: `x in some_string` - Substring vs. Character**

A common conceptual pitfall, especially for beginners, is implicitly assuming `x in some_string` *only* checks for single characters, or that it behaves like checking for elements in a list of characters.

Python's `in` operator for strings performs a **substring search**. This means it will return `True` if the *entire sequence* `x` is found anywhere within `some_string`.

```python
sentence = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

# Expected: single character check
print(f"'q' in sentence: {'q' in sentence}") # Output: True

# Expected: substring check - works as intended
print(f"'quick' in sentence: {'quick' in sentence}") # Output: True

# Pitfall scenario: assuming only 'c', 'k', or 'u' individually would match
# It requires the *sequence* 'uck' to be present.
print(f"'uck' in sentence: {'uck' in sentence}")     # Output: True (from "quick")

# Will not find 'q', 'u', 'i', 'c', 'k' separately
print(f"'quik' in sentence: {'quik' in sentence}")   # Output: False (no exact substring match)

# This is NOT equivalent to:
# list_of_chars = list(sentence)
# 'q' in list_of_chars # True
# 'quick' in list_of_chars # False
```

*The uncompromising programmer is explicit about string membership: `in` searches for a contiguous substring. If you need to check for the presence of *any* character from a set, you might use a loop or set intersection, not direct string `in` for multi-character `x`.*

### **9. Ternary Conditional Operator: Concise Conditional Expressions**

The ternary conditional operator (often just called the "ternary operator") is Python's way of writing a simple `if-else` statement on a single line, as an **expression**. This means it evaluates to a value, making it suitable for assignments, function arguments, or within other expressions. For the uncompromising programmer, understanding when to leverage its conciseness and when to avoid its potential for obfuscation is crucial for writing Pythonic and maintainable code.

#### **Syntax: `value_if_true if condition else value_if_false`**

The general form is:
`expression_if_true` **`if`** `condition` **`else`** `expression_if_false`

  * `condition`: An expression that evaluates to `True` or `False` (or a truthy/falsy value).
  * `expression_if_true`: The value returned if the `condition` is `True`.
  * `expression_if_false`: The value returned if the `condition` is `False`.

This operator is an **expression**, not a statement. This is a key differentiator from `if-else` *statements*.

```python
# Simple example
age = 20
status = "Adult" if age >= 18 else "Minor"
print(f"Age {age} -> Status: {status}") # Output: Age 20 -> Status: Adult

age = 15
status = "Adult" if age >= 18 else "Minor"
print(f"Age {age} -> Status: {status}") # Output: Age 15 -> Status: Minor

# Assigning based on a condition
temp = 25
weather = "Warm" if temp > 20 else "Cool"
print(f"Temperature {temp}C -> Weather: {weather}")

# Using in a print statement directly
user_score = 75
print(f"You { 'passed' if user_score >= 60 else 'failed' } the exam.")

# Using with function calls
def get_greeting(hour):
    return "Good morning!" if 6 <= hour < 12 else \
           "Good afternoon!" if 12 <= hour < 18 else \
           "Good evening!"

print(get_greeting(9))  # Good morning!
print(get_greeting(14)) # Good afternoon!
print(get_greeting(20)) # Good evening!
```

#### **When to Use, When Not to Use**

The ternary operator excels at making simple conditional assignments or return values more concise.

**When to Use:**

1.  **Simple Assignments:** When you need to assign a value to a variable based on a single condition.
    ```python
    # Instead of:
    # if num % 2 == 0:
    #     parity = "even"
    # else:
    #     parity = "odd"
    # Use:
    num = 7
    parity = "even" if num % 2 == 0 else "odd"
    print(parity) # odd
    ```
2.  **Function Return Values:** When a function's return value depends on a straightforward condition.
    ```python
    def get_max(a, b):
        return a if a > b else b
    print(get_max(10, 5)) # 10
    ```
3.  **Inline Expressions:** When the condition and its results are short and directly enhance readability within a larger expression (like f-strings, list comprehensions).
    ```python
    is_admin = True
    print(f"Access granted: { 'Admin Privileges' if is_admin else 'Standard User' }")

    data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    squared_evens = [x**2 if x % 2 == 0 else x for x in data]
    print(squared_evens) # [1, 4, 3, 16, 5]
    ```
4.  **Clarity over Verbosity:** For truly simple binary choices, it reduces boilerplate and can improve readability by keeping related logic on one line.

**When NOT to Use (The Uncompromising Programmer's Caution):**

1.  **Complex Logic:** If your `condition` or `expression_if_true`/`expression_if_false` are complex (e.g., involve multiple lines of code, side effects, or nested logic), an `if-else` statement is almost always more readable.
    ```python
    # Avoid this! (Difficult to read)
    # result = (long_complex_calculation_1() if some_condition_1 else
    #           another_complex_calculation() + some_value_from_db()
    #           if another_condition else
    #           final_fallback_logic())
    ```
2.  **Side Effects:** If the primary purpose of the conditional logic is to *perform an action* (e.g., print something, modify an external state) rather than to produce a value, an `if-else` statement is semantically clearer.
    ```python
    # Don't use ternary for side effects:
    # "Item updated" if update_item_in_db() else "Error updating item" # while syntactically valid, it's not clear that update_item_in_db() is the primary action.

    # Instead, use an if-else statement for actions:
    if update_item_in_db():
        print("Item updated successfully.")
    else:
        print("Error updating item.")
    ```
3.  **Readability Sacrifice:** If using the ternary operator makes the code harder for another developer (or your future self) to understand quickly, don't use it. Conciseness is a virtue, but clarity is paramount.

#### **Nesting Danger**

While technically possible, **nesting ternary operators is highly discouraged** due to severe readability issues. Each nested operator adds another layer of mental parsing.

```python
# AVOID NESTING TERNARY OPERATORS!
# Example: Determining grade based on score
score = 85
grade = "A" if score >= 90 else ("B" if score >= 80 else ("C" if score >= 70 else "F"))
print(f"Score {score} -> Grade: {grade}") # Output: Score 85 -> Grade: B
```

**Why it's dangerous:**

  * **Cognitive Load:** The human brain struggles to parse multiple `if ... else` clauses strung together on a single line, especially when they aren't vertically aligned.
  * **Debugging:** Tracing the flow of logic in a nested ternary can be a nightmare.
  * **Maintainability:** Modifying or extending such a line of code is prone to errors.

**Uncompromising Alternative for Multiple Conditions:**
For more than two branches, prefer:

1.  **`if/elif/else` statements:** The most readable solution for sequential conditions.
    ```python
    score = 85
    if score >= 90:
        grade = "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        grade = "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        grade = "C"
    else:
        grade = "F"
    print(f"Score {score} -> Grade: {grade}")
    ```
2.  **Dictionary Lookup (for fixed mappings):** If conditions map directly to values.
    ```python
    status_codes = {200: "OK", 404: "Not Found", 500: "Server Error"}
    response_code = 404
    status_message = status_codes.get(response_code, "Unknown Status")
    print(status_message) # Not Found
    ```
3.  **Functions:** Encapsulate complex logic within a well-named function.

#### **Common Pattern: Return-Based Expressions**

A particularly common and Pythonic use of the ternary operator is when a function needs to return one of two values based on a condition, without requiring intermediate variable assignment. This keeps the function body very lean.

```python
def check_temperature_status(temp_celsius):
    """
    Returns 'Freezing' if temp <= 0, otherwise 'Above Freezing'.
    """
    return "Freezing" if temp_celsius <= 0 else "Above Freezing"

print(f"Water at 5C: {check_temperature_status(5)}")   # Output: Water at 5C: Above Freezing
print(f"Water at 0C: {check_temperature_status(0)}")   # Output: Water at 0C: Freezing
print(f"Water at -5C: {check_temperature_status(-5)}") # Output: Water at -5C: Freezing

def get_discount_price(original_price, is_premium_member):
    """
    Calculates price with 10% discount for premium members.
    """
    return original_price * 0.90 if is_premium_member else original_price

product_price = 100
print(f"Regular price: ${get_discount_price(product_price, False):.2f}") # $100.00
print(f"Premium price: ${get_discount_price(product_price, True):.2f}")  # $90.00
```

This pattern is clean, directly expresses the intent, and leverages the fact that the ternary operator is an expression that yields a value.

*The uncompromising programmer wields the ternary operator judiciously: for concise, single-line conditional assignments and returns when clarity is maintained. They unequivocally avoid nesting and prefer explicit `if/elif/else` statements or other structures for more complex decision trees.*
