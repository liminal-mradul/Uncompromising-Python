This is a fantastic challenge. These questions are designed to be impossible to solve without a deep, thoughtful reading of the entire loops chapter. They require you to combine multiple concepts and reason about subtle interactions and edge cases.

### Problem Set 2: Conceptual Mastery

#### Category 1: Code Writing (10 Questions)

1.  **Matrix Transposition with Comprehension:** Write a function `transpose(matrix)` that takes a matrix (list of lists) and returns its transpose using a single list comprehension. Your function should handle matrices of any size.

2.  **Custom `enumerate()` with `while`:** Implement a function `my_enumerate(iterable)` that behaves exactly like `enumerate(iterable)`, using only a `while` loop, the `iter()` function, and the `next()` function. Your function should return a list of `(index, item)` tuples.

3.  **Find the Palindrome:** Write a function `find_palindromes(sentence)` that takes a string, finds all unique words in it that are palindromes (read the same forwards and backward), and returns them as a set. The search should be case-insensitive and ignore punctuation.

4.  **Complex Conditional Filtering:** Write a function `filter_data(names, ages, min_age, max_age)` that takes a list of names and a list of corresponding ages. It should return a list of names for all individuals whose age falls within the `min_age` and `max_age` range (inclusive). Use `zip()` and a list comprehension.

5.  **Flatten a Nested List:** Write a function `flatten(nested_list)` that takes a list of lists and flattens it into a single list. For example, `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]` becomes `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Your solution should use nested loops.

6.  **Secure Password Checker:** Write a function `check_password()` that uses a `while True` loop to repeatedly ask the user for a password. The loop should have the following rules, with an immediate `break` on success or failure:

      * Password must be at least 8 characters long.
      * Password must contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit.
      * If any condition is not met, print a specific error message.
      * If all conditions are met, print "Password accepted\!" and exit the loop.

7.  **Find the First Common Element:** Write a function `find_first_common(l1, l2)` that takes two lists and returns the first element that appears in both lists. Your solution must use nested loops and stop as soon as the first common element is found. If no common elements are found, return `None`.

8.  **Unique Word Frequencies:** Write a function `word_frequency(text)` that takes a string of text. Use loops to build a dictionary where each key is a unique word from the text and each value is its frequency count. Words should be treated as case-insensitive.

9.  **`range()` Reverse Slicing:** Given a list `l` and a positive integer `n`, write a single `for` loop that uses `range()` and slicing to print the elements of the list in reverse order, in groups of `n`. For example, `l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` and `n = 3` should print `[7, 6, 5]`, then `[4, 3, 2]`, then `[1]`.

10. **Custom `zip()` with `while`:** Implement a function `my_zip(l1, l2)` that mimics the behavior of `zip()` using a `while` loop and indices. Your function should return a list of tuples and stop when the shorter list is exhausted.

11. **Output Prediction:** What is the output of this code, and why?

    ```python
    x = 0
    for i in range(3):
        if i == 1:
            continue
        for j in range(3):
            if j == 1:
                break
            x += 1
    print(x)
    ```

12. **Error Detection:** Identify the error and its cause.

    ```python
    l = ["a", "b", "c"]
    i = 0
    while True:
        if i == len(l):
            break
        print(l[i])
        i -= 1
    ```

13. **Logical Overflow:** The following code finds the highest odd number in a list. What is the output, and why is the logic flawed for certain inputs?

    ```python
    def find_highest_odd(numbers):
        highest_odd = 0
        for num in numbers:
            if num % 2 != 0:
                if num > highest_odd:
                    highest_odd = num
        return highest_odd
    print(find_highest_odd([2, 4, 6, -1, -3]))
    ```

14. **Output Prediction (Nested `for...else`):** Predict the output and explain the logic.

    ```python
    for i in range(2):
        for j in range(2):
            if i == 1 and j == 1:
                break
            print(f"{i}-{j}")
        else:
            print(f"Inner else for i={i}")
    else:
        print("Outer else")
    ```

15. **Output Prediction (`zip` and `reversed`):** What is the final value of `output`?

    ```python
    output = ""
    l1 = ["a", "b", "c"]
    l2 = [3, 2, 1]
    for char, num in zip(reversed(l1), l2):
        output += f"{char}{num}"
    print(output)
    ```

16. **Error Detection:** Will this code produce an error? If so, why?

    ```python
    s = "hello"
    it = iter(s)
    try:
        while True:
            print(next(it))
    except StopIteration:
        print("Done")
    ```

17. **Logical Overflow:** The code tries to remove all occurrences of `5` from a list. Why does it fail to remove all of them?

    ```python
    l = [1, 5, 2, 5, 3, 5]
    for i, num in enumerate(l):
        if num == 5:
            l.remove(num)
    print(l)
    ```

18. **Constraint Mapping:** The following code finds the average of a list of numbers. Under what constraint does it fail? How would you fix it?

    ```python
    l = [1, 2, 3]
    total = 0
    for num in l:
        total += num
    average = total / len(l)
    print(average)
    ```

19. **Output Prediction (Generator):** What is the output of this code?

    ```python
    gen = (x*x for x in range(3))
    total = 0
    for i in gen:
        total += i
    print(total)
    print(list(gen))
    ```

20. **Debugging:** The following code is supposed to find the first common character between two strings, but it only works if the first string is longer. What is the bug?

    ```python
    s1 = "abcdef"
    s2 = "xyz"
    for i in range(len(s1)):
        for j in range(len(s2)):
            if s1[i] == s2[j]:
                print("Match found!")
                break
    ```

21. **Output Prediction:** Predict the output and explain the behavior of `continue`.

    ```python
    for i in range(1, 4):
        print(f"Outer loop: {i}")
        for j in range(1, 4):
            if i * j == 2:
                continue
            print(f"  Inner loop: {j}")
    ```

22. **Logical Overflow:** This code finds the index of a target in a list. Why is the `for...else` block not executing correctly?

    ```python
    l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    target = 6
    found_index = -1
    for i, num in enumerate(l):
        if num == target:
            found_index = i
            break
    else:
        found_index = None
    print(found_index)
    ```

23. **Output Prediction:** What happens when this code runs?

    ```python
    l = [1, 2]
    for i in l:
        l.append(i + 2)
        if len(l) > 10:
            break
    print(l)
    ```

24. **Error Detection:** Identify the error and its cause.

    ```python
    my_list = [1, 2, 3]
    for i in range(len(my_list)):
        print(my_list[i])
        my_list.pop(i)
    ```

25. **Logical Overflow:** This code checks if a list contains any duplicate values. Why is it highly inefficient? What is a better approach?

    ```python
    def has_duplicates(arr):
        for i in range(len(arr)):
            for j in range(len(arr)):
                if i != j and arr[i] == arr[j]:
                    return True
        return False
    ```

26. **Output Prediction:** What is the output of this set comprehension?

    ```python
    l = ["apple", "orange", "apple", "grape"]
    s = {x for x in l if len(x) > 5}
    print(s)
    ```

27. **Constraint Mapping:** The following code counts the number of times a sub-string appears in a string. Under what constraint does it fail? How would you fix it?

    ```python
    s = "ababab"
    sub = "aba"
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i:i+len(sub)] == sub:
            count += 1
    print(count)
    ```

28. **Debugging:** The code is intended to print a pattern, but it prints an unexpected output. Fix the code.

    ```python
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(i):
            print("*", end="")
        print()
    ```

29. **Output Prediction:** What is the output of this code?

    ```python
    l1 = [1, 2, 3]
    l2 = [4, 5, 6]
    for x, y in zip(l1, l2):
        if x == 2:
            l1.append(10)
        print(f"{x}-{y}")
    ```

30. **Logical Overflow:** This `while` loop is meant to stop after 100 iterations. Why does it not?

    ```python
    i = 0
    while i < 100:
        if i == 50:
            i = 0
        i += 1
    print("Loop finished")
    ```
