### 1\. Output Prediction (15 Questions)

**Instructions:** Predict the final output of each code snippet.

1.  ```python
    x = 0
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(i + 1, 3):
            x += 1
    print(x)
    ```

    **Answer:** `3`. The inner loop runs `2` times when `i=0`, `1` time when `i=1`, and `0` times when `i=2`. Total iterations are `2 + 1 + 0 = 3`.

2.  ```python
    s = "Python"
    output = ""
    for char in s:
        if char == 'o':
            continue
        output += char
    print(output)
    ```

    **Answer:** `Pythn`. The `continue` statement skips the rest of the loop block for the character 'o'.

3.  ```python
    output = 0
    for i in range(1, 4):
        if i == 2:
            break
        output += i
    else:
        output = 10
    print(output)
    ```

    **Answer:** `1`. The `break` statement is triggered when `i` is `2`, which terminates the loop prematurely. The `else` block is therefore skipped.

4.  ```python
    l = [1, 2, 3]
    for i in l[:]:
        l.remove(i)
    print(l)
    ```

    **Answer:** `[2]`. The loop iterates over a copy `l[:]`. `1` is removed from `l`. The loop continues, finds `2` in the copy, but then removes `2` from the original list `l`. `3` is not found in the copy and thus is not removed.

5.  ```python
    s = "abcde"
    output = ""
    for i in range(len(s) - 1, -1, -2):
        output += s[i]
    print(output)
    ```

    **Answer:** `eca`. The loop starts at index `4`, steps backward by `2`, so it accesses indices `4`, `2`, and `0`.

6.  ```python
    x = 10
    while x > 0:
        if x == 5:
            x -= 2
            continue
        x -= 1
    print(x)
    ```

    **Answer:** `-1`. When `x` is `5`, `x` becomes `3` and the `continue` is executed. The `x -= 1` is skipped, so the next iteration starts with `x=3`. The loop proceeds, decrementing `x` until it becomes `-1`.

7.  ```python
    l1 = [1, 2, 3]
    l2 = [4, 5, 6, 7]
    output = []
    for x, y in zip(l1, l2):
        output.append(x * y)
    print(output)
    ```

    **Answer:** `[4, 10, 18]`. `zip` stops when the shortest list (`l1`) is exhausted. It performs `1*4`, `2*5`, and `3*6`.

8.  ```python
    matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
    total = 0
    for row in reversed(matrix):
        for val in row:
            total += val
    print(total)
    ```

    **Answer:** `10`. The `reversed()` function iterates over the matrix rows in reverse order (`[3, 4]` then `[1, 2]`), but the sum is the same regardless of order.

9.  ```python
    def my_gen():
        for i in range(3):
            yield i

    x = 0
    for i in my_gen():
        x += i
    print(x)
    ```

    **Answer:** `3`. The loop iterates over the generator, which yields `0`, `1`, and `2`. The sum is `0+1+2=3`.

10. ```python
    s = "abcdef"
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            print(char, end="")
        else:
            continue
    ```

    **Answer:** `ace`. `enumerate` gives indices `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5`. The `if` condition is true for indices `0, 2, 4`, printing `a`, `c`, `e`.

11. ```python
    total = 0
    for i in range(10):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            total += i
        else:
            total = 0
    print(total)
    ```

    **Answer:** `9`. The loop accumulates `0` and `3`. Then `4` makes `total` `0`. Then `6` makes `total` `6`. Then `7,8` make `total` `0`. Then `9` makes `total` `9`. Finally `total` remains `9`.

12. ```python
    l = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
    for i in range(2):
        for j in range(2):
            if i == j:
                continue
            print(l[i][j], end="")
    ```

    **Answer:** `23`. The `continue` skips when `i` equals `j` (for `(0,0)` and `(1,1)`). The loop prints `l[0][1]` which is `2`, and `l[1][0]` which is `3`.

13. ```python
    l = [1, 2, 3]
    output = 0
    for i in l:
        l.append(4)
        output += 1
        if output > 5:
            break
    print(output)
    ```

    **Answer:** `6`. This creates an infinite loop where the list keeps growing. The loop will only terminate due to the `break` when `output` exceeds `5`.

14. ```python
    l = ['a', 'b', 'c']
    d = {}
    for i, item in enumerate(l):
        d[i] = item
    print(d)
    ```

    **Answer:** `{0: 'a', 1: 'b', 2: 'c'}`. `enumerate` creates a sequence of `(index, item)` tuples which are used to build a dictionary.

15. ```python
    def find_min(arr):
        if not arr: return None
        min_val = arr[0]
        for x in arr:
            if x < min_val:
                min_val = x
        return min_val

    print(find_min([5, 3, 8, -1, 10]))
    ```

    **Answer:** `-1`. The loop correctly initializes `min_val` and updates it whenever a smaller value is found.

### 2\. Error Detection (10 Questions)

**Instructions:** Identify the error (if any) in the following code snippets and explain why it occurs.

16. ```python
    for i in range(10, 0):
        print(i)
    ```

    **Answer:** No error, but no output. `range(10, 0)` with a default step of `1` produces an empty sequence because the start is greater than the stop.

17. ```python
    l = [1, 2, 3]
    for i in l:
        if i == 2:
            l.remove(i)
    print(l)
    ```

    **Answer:** No error, but a logical bug. The loop skips an element. When `2` is removed, the list becomes `[1, 3]`. The loop moves to index `2` which is now out of bounds but doesn't throw an error because the list is now shorter. The `for` loop's internal iterator correctly handles this by stopping. The final output is `[1, 3]` and the loop incorrectly skipped `3`.

18. ```python
    l = [1, 2, 3]
    i = 0
    while i <= len(l):
        print(l[i])
        i += 1
    ```

    **Answer:** `IndexError`. The loop condition `i <= len(l)` is an off-by-one error. When `i` becomes `3` (the length of the list), the loop tries to access `l[3]`, which is out of bounds. The condition should be `i < len(l)`.

19. ```python
    s1 = "abc"
    s2 = "def"
    for char in zip(s1, s2):
        print(char)
    ```

    **Answer:** `TypeError`. `zip(s1, s2)` returns an iterator of tuples `('a','d')`, etc. The code tries to unpack `char` as a single variable, but `char` receives a tuple. The loop should be `for c1, c2 in zip(s1, s2):`.

20. ```python
    i = 0
    while i < 10:
        print(i)
    ```

    **Answer:** Infinite loop. The variable `i` is never incremented, so the condition `i < 10` is always `True`. The program will never terminate.

21. ```python
    d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
    for k, v in d.items():
        if k == 'a':
            d.pop('a')
    ```

    **Answer:** `RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration`. You cannot modify the size of a dictionary while iterating over it. To fix this, iterate over a copy: `for k, v in list(d.items()):`.

22. ```python
    def find_all_odds(arr):
        odds = []
        for x in arr:
            if x % 2 == 1:
                odds.append(x)
        return odds

    print(find_all_odds([1, 2, 3.5, 4]))
    ```

    **Answer:** `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for %: 'float' and 'int'`. The `%` operator cannot be used with a float. The code should be protected with a `type(x) is int` check.

23. ```python
    output = 0
    for i in range(1, 5):
        output += i
        if output > 5:
            continue
    print(output)
    ```

    **Answer:** No error, but tricky logic. The `continue` statement is in a strange place, but it simply skips to the next iteration. It does not affect the calculation of `output` as it comes after `output += i`. The final output is `10`.

24. ```python
    l = [1, 2, 3]
    for i in l:
        l.append(4)
        if len(l) > 10:
            break
    print(l)
    ```

    **Answer:** This will print `[1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]` or similar. The loop is iterating over a growing list. The `for` loop's internal iterator gets confused by the expanding list, but it's not a hard error; it's a logical bug where the list keeps growing until the `break` is hit. This is a subtle anti-pattern.

25. ```python
    x = 5
    while x > 0:
        x -= 1
        if x == 0:
            break
    else:
        print("Done")
    ```

    **Answer:** No error. No output. The `break` statement prevents the `else` block from executing.

### 3\. Logical Overflow & Debugging (10 Questions)

**Instructions:** The following code snippets run without error but produce an incorrect or unexpected result. Explain the logical flaw and provide the corrected code.

26. **Problem:** The code is meant to find the maximum value in a list, but it fails for lists with negative numbers.

    ```python
    def find_max(arr):
        max_val = 0
        for x in arr:
            if x > max_val:
                max_val = x
        return max_val
    print(find_max([-10, -5, -20])) # Expected: -5, Actual: 0
    ```

    **Answer:** The logical flaw is that `max_val` is initialized to `0`. If all numbers in the list are negative, the condition `x > max_val` is never met, and the function incorrectly returns `0`.
    **Corrected Code:** Initialize `max_val` to the first element of the list, or use `min()` and `max()`.

    ```python
    def find_max(arr):
        if not arr: return None
        max_val = arr[0]
        for x in arr:
            if x > max_val:
                max_val = x
        return max_val
    ```

27. **Problem:** This code is meant to print a `*` for each item in a list, but it prints an extra `*` at the end.

    ```python
    items = ['a', 'b', 'c']
    for item in items:
        print("*", end=" ")
    print()
    ```

    **Answer:** The flaw is the `print()` statement after the loop. The `for` loop already prints a `*` and a space for each item. The final `print()` adds a newline, but the problem states an extra `*` is printed, which is a misunderstanding. A better example:
    **Problem:** The code is meant to separate each item by a comma, but it adds an extra comma at the end.

    ```python
    items = ["apple", "orange", "banana"]
    output = ""
    for item in items:
        output += item + ", "
    print(output)
    ```

    **Answer:** The flaw is that a comma and space are added after every item, including the last one. The `print` statement just prints this final string.
    **Corrected Code:** Use `str.join()`, which is the Pythonic way to do this.

    ```python
    items = ["apple", "orange", "banana"]
    print(", ".join(items))
    ```

28. **Problem:** This loop is meant to print the numbers 1 to 5.

    ```python
    i = 1
    while i < 5:
        print(i)
        i += 1
    ```

    **Answer:** The loop is off-by-one. It prints up to `4`, not `5`.
    **Corrected Code:** The condition should be `i <= 5`.

29. **Problem:** This code fails to count the total number of items in a nested list.

    ```python
    matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4, 5]]
    count = 0
    for row in matrix:
        count += row
    print(count)
    ```

    **Answer:** `TypeError`. The `+=` operator is trying to add a list (`row`) to an integer (`count`).
    **Corrected Code:** The `count` should be incremented by the length of the inner list.

    ```python
    count = 0
    for row in matrix:
        count += len(row)
    print(count) # or simply sum(len(row) for row in matrix)
    ```

30. **Problem:** This code fails to correctly reverse a string.

    ```python
    s = "Python"
    reversed_s = ""
    for i in range(len(s)):
        reversed_s += s[i]
    print(reversed_s)
    ```

    **Answer:** The loop is iterating forward. It simply reconstructs the original string.
    **Corrected Code:** Iterate backward using `range` or `reversed()`.

    ```python
    reversed_s = ""
    for i in range(len(s) - 1, -1, -1):
        reversed_s += s[i]
    ```

31. **Problem:** The code is intended to print all unique numbers from a list, but it prints duplicates.

    ```python
    numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4]
    unique_numbers = []
    for num in numbers:
        if num not in unique_numbers:
            unique_numbers.append(num)
    print(unique_numbers)
    ```

    **Answer:** No logical flaw. The code correctly produces `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The question is a trick. The correct way to get unique items is using a set: `print(set(numbers))`.

32. **Problem:** The code finds the first pair in a list that sums to 10, but its performance is very poor.

    ```python
    l = [1, 5, 2, 8, 3, 7, 4, 6]
    target = 10
    for i in range(len(l)):
        for j in range(len(l)):
            if i != j and l[i] + l[j] == target:
                print(l[i], l[j])
    ```

    **Answer:** The logical flaw is that it checks the same pairs twice and compares an element to itself. The performance is $O(N^2)$.
    **Corrected Code:** The inner loop should start from `i+1` to avoid duplicate checks and self-comparison.

    ```python
    for i in range(len(l)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(l)):
            if l[i] + l[j] == target:
                print(l[i], l[j])
    ```

33. **Problem:** The code is supposed to find an item and print a "found" message, but it prints "Not found" even when the item is in the list.

    ```python
    items = ["a", "b", "c"]
    target = "b"
    found = False
    for item in items:
        if item == target:
            print("Found!")
        else:
            print("Not found.")
    ```

    **Answer:** The flaw is the `else` block. It prints "Not found" for every item that isn't the target.
    **Corrected Code:** Use a flag and check after the loop, or better, use `for...else`.

    ```python
    items = ["a", "b", "c"]
    target = "b"
    for item in items:
        if item == target:
            print("Found!")
            break
    else:
        print("Not found.")
    ```

34. **Problem:** The code is supposed to print numbers 1-3 but prints nothing.

    ```python
    i = 1
    while i < 4:
        i += 1
        print(i)
    ```

    **Answer:** The flaw is that `i` is incremented *before* it is printed. It will print 2, 3, 4. To print 1, 2, 3, print before incrementing.
    **Corrected Code:**

    ```python
    i = 1
    while i < 4:
        print(i)
        i += 1
    ```

35. **Problem:** The code is supposed to filter out all occurrences of a number, but it fails to do so completely.

    ```python
    l = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]
    for x in l:
        if x == 2:
            l.remove(x)
    print(l)
    ```

    **Answer:** It produces `[1, 3, 2, 4]`. The problem is modifying a list while iterating. The loop removes the first `2` at index `1`, but then skips over the next element (the `3`), and then misses the second `2`.
    **Corrected Code:** Iterate over a copy or use a list comprehension.

    ```python
    l = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]
    l = [x for x in l if x != 2]
    print(l)
    ```

### 4\. Constraint Mapping & Fixing (15 Questions)

**Instructions:** Identify the constraints under which the logic works correctly. Then, fix the logic to work for all cases.

36. **Problem:** The loop finds the first negative number in a list but fails if the list is empty.

    ```python
    def find_first_negative(arr):
        for x in arr:
            if x < 0:
                return x
    print(find_first_negative([]))
    ```

    **Answer:** **Constraint:** The list `arr` must not be empty. **Fix:** Add a check for an empty list and return a sensible default value like `None`.

    ```python
    def find_first_negative(arr):
        if not arr: return None
        for x in arr:
            if x < 0:
                return x
        return None # Return None if no negative number is found
    ```

37. **Problem:** The code attempts to reverse a string but fails for an empty string.

    ```python
    s = "abc"
    reversed_s = ""
    i = len(s) - 1
    while i >= 0:
        reversed_s += s[i]
        i -= 1
    print(reversed_s)
    ```

    **Answer:** **Constraint:** The string `s` must not be empty. If it is, `len(s)-1` is `-1`, and the loop `i >= 0` is initially `False`. It doesn't run at all and returns an empty string, which is correct, but the logic is brittle. **Fix:** The code is correct as is, but a more robust check is wise. The real issue would be if `s` was not a string. `reversed()` is more robust.
    **Corrected Code:**

    ```python
    s = "" # Test with an empty string
    reversed_s = ""
    for char in reversed(s):
        reversed_s += char
    print(reversed_s) # Output: ""
    ```

38. **Problem:** This code sums numbers but fails if the list contains non-integer values.

    ```python
    l = [1, 2, 3, "four"]
    total = 0
    for x in l:
        total += x
    ```

    **Answer:** **Constraint:** All elements in the list must be of a numeric type. **Fix:** Use a `try...except` block to handle `TypeError` or use `isinstance()` to check the type.
    **Corrected Code:**

    ```python
    l = [1, 2, 3, "four"]
    total = 0
    for x in l:
        if isinstance(x, (int, float)):
            total += x
    print(total)
    ```

39. **Problem:** This code prints all elements of a list but only works for lists with a length greater than 0.

    ```python
    l = []
    i = 0
    while i < len(l):
        print(l[i])
        i += 1
    ```

    **Answer:** **Constraint:** The list `l` must not be empty. The code produces no output for an empty list, which is correct behavior but doesn't handle all cases gracefully. A better design might be to print a message if the list is empty. **Fix:** The `for` loop is the correct tool for this as it handles empty iterables by default.
    **Corrected Code:**

    ```python
    l = []
    if not l:
        print("List is empty")
    else:
        for x in l:
            print(x)
    ```

40. **Problem:** The code below correctly filters out all negative numbers but fails if the list is extremely large.

    ```python
    l = [i for i in range(-10000000, 10000000)]
    positives = [x for x in l if x > 0]
    ```

    **Answer:** **Constraint:** The input list `l` must fit in memory. For an extremely large list, the list comprehension will cause a `MemoryError`. **Fix:** Use a generator expression to process the data lazily without storing the entire list in memory.
    **Corrected Code:**

    ```python
    l = range(-10000000, 10000000)
    positives = (x for x in l if x > 0)
    # The 'positives' is now a generator, not a list.
    # We can now iterate over it without memory issues.
    # for x in positives:
    #     print(x)
    ```

41. **Problem:** The code removes all vowels from a string, but it fails if the string contains uppercase vowels.

    ```python
    s = "Python is a language"
    vowels = "aeiou"
    output = ""
    for char in s:
        if char not in vowels:
            output += char
    print(output)
    ```

    **Answer:** **Constraint:** The string `s` must only contain lowercase vowels. **Fix:** Convert the character to lowercase before checking.
    **Corrected Code:**

    ```python
    s = "Python is a language"
    vowels = "aeiou"
    output = ""
    for char in s:
        if char.lower() not in vowels:
            output += char
    print(output)
    ```

42. **Problem:** The loop is supposed to find the index of the first occurrence of a number, but it fails if the number is not in the list.

    ```python
    l = [10, 20, 30]
    target = 40
    for i, num in enumerate(l):
        if num == target:
            print(f"Found at index {i}")
    ```

    **Answer:** **Constraint:** The `target` value must be in the list. If it isn't, the loop simply finishes and nothing is printed. **Fix:** Use a `for...else` block or a flag variable to handle the "not found" case gracefully.
    **Corrected Code:**

    ```python
    l = [10, 20, 30]
    target = 40
    for i, num in enumerate(l):
        if num == target:
            print(f"Found at index {i}")
            break
    else:
        print(f"{target} not found.")
    ```

43. **Problem:** The code transposes a matrix but fails if the rows have different lengths.

    ```python
    matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]
    transposed = zip(*matrix)
    print(list(transposed))
    ```

    **Answer:** **Constraint:** All rows in the matrix must have the same length. `zip()` stops when the shortest row (`[4, 5]`) is exhausted, resulting in an incomplete transpose. **Fix:** This is a tricky problem. The standard `zip` behavior is the only simple solution, so the fix is to handle the input data to ensure it is rectangular before transposing. Or, use `itertools.zip_longest()`.

44. **Problem:** The code removes all occurrences of a number from a list, but it fails to remove all of them.

    ```python
    l = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2]
    for x in l:
        if x == 2:
            l.remove(x)
    print(l)
    ```

    **Answer:** **Constraint:** The number to be removed can't appear multiple times. **Fix:** The issue is modifying the list during iteration. A correct fix is to iterate over a copy or use a list comprehension.
    **Corrected Code:**

    ```python
    l = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2]
    l = [x for x in l if x != 2]
    print(l)
    ```

45. **Problem:** The loop is meant to print a progress bar with a fixed number of steps but fails if the total number of items is not a multiple of the step size.

    ```python
    items = list(range(10)) # Total items: 10
    total = len(items)
    step = 3
    progress_count = 0
    for i in range(0, total, step):
        progress_count += step
        print(f"Progress: {progress_count / total * 100}%")
    ```

    **Answer:** **Constraint:** The number of items (`total`) must be perfectly divisible by `step`. The loop will end at 9, and the progress will stop at 90%. **Fix:** Calculate the progress based on the loop variable `i` itself and a final check after the loop.
    **Corrected Code:**

    ```python
    items = list(range(10))
    total = len(items)
    step = 3
    for i in range(0, total, step):
        progress = (i + step) / total * 100
        print(f"Progress: {min(progress, 100)}%")
    ```

46. **Problem:** The code is supposed to check if all elements in a list are positive, but it fails for an empty list.

    ```python
    def all_positive(arr):
        for x in arr:
            if x <= 0:
                return False
        return True
    print(all_positive([])) # Expected: True, Actual: True, but the logic is brittle
    ```

    **Answer:** **Constraint:** The list must not be empty for the `for` loop to run. For an empty list, the loop is skipped, and it returns `True`, which is the correct behavior, but the logic is implicit. **Fix:** No fix needed for correctness, but the Pythonic solution `all(x > 0 for x in arr)` is more robust and readable.

47. **Problem:** The code removes items from a dictionary but fails when the key to be removed is the last item.

    ```python
    d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
    keys_to_remove = ['b', 'c']
    for k in d.keys():
        if k in keys_to_remove:
            del d[k]
    ```

    **Answer:** **Constraint:** This fails if a key is removed that is after the current position in the iterator. This can lead to `RuntimeError`. **Fix:** Iterate over a copy of the dictionary's keys.
    **Corrected Code:**

    ```python
    d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
    keys_to_remove = ['b', 'c']
    for k in list(d.keys()):
        if k in keys_to_remove:
            del d[k]
    ```

48. **Problem:** The code finds the first non-space character but fails if the string is empty or contains only spaces.

    ```python
    s = "   "
    for char in s:
        if char != ' ':
            print(f"Found: {char}")
            break
    ```

    **Answer:** **Constraint:** The string must contain at least one non-space character. If it doesn't, the loop finishes without printing anything, which is a silent failure. **Fix:** Use a flag or `for...else` to provide feedback when no non-space character is found.
    **Corrected Code:**

    ```python
    s = "   "
    for char in s:
        if char != ' ':
            print(f"Found: {char}")
            break
    else:
        print("No non-space characters found.")
    ```

49. **Problem:** The code calculates the sum of all elements in a list, but fails if the list contains a non-numeric type.

    ```python
    l = [1, 2, '3', 4]
    total = 0
    for x in l:
        total += x
    print(total)
    ```

    **Answer:** **Constraint:** All elements must be numeric. The `+=` operator will fail. **Fix:** Explicitly check the type or use a `try-except` block.
    **Corrected Code:**

    ```python
    l = [1, 2, '3', 4]
    total = 0
    for x in l:
        try:
            total += int(x)
        except (ValueError, TypeError):
            print(f"Skipping non-numeric value: {x}")
    print(total)
    ```

50. **Problem:** The code finds a specific item and prints its index, but fails if there are multiple occurrences of the item.

    ```python
    l = [10, 20, 30, 20, 40]
    target = 20
    for i, num in enumerate(l):
        if num == target:
            print(f"Found at index {i}")
            break
    ```

    **Answer:** **Constraint:** The target item must appear only once. If it appears multiple times, the `break` statement will cause the loop to exit after finding the first one. **Fix:** To find all occurrences, remove the `break` statement.
    **Corrected Code:**

    ```python
    l = [10, 20, 30, 20, 40]
    target = 20
    for i, num in enumerate(l):
        if num == target:
            print(f"Found at index {i}")
    ```
