# üìò Chapter 19: Working with Time, Date, and Schedulers

> *"Time is the invisible axis that every program runs along ‚Äî learn to bend it to your will."*

---

## üéØ Chapter Goals

By the end of this chapter, readers will:

* Master Python‚Äôs `datetime`, `date`, `time`, and `timedelta`.
* Work with **timestamps** for storage and portability.
* Handle **time zones** and daylight saving time correctly.
* Measure **code performance** with `time` and `timeit`.
* Schedule tasks with `sched` and custom loops.
* Understand how to **format, parse, and manipulate** time data.
* Avoid common pitfalls like naive vs aware datetimes.

---

## üìÇ Chapter Structure

### 19.1 Understanding Time in Python

* System time vs wall clock time vs monotonic time.
* Naive vs aware datetime objects.
* Why UTC is the safest default in programming.

üì¶ **Philosophy Box:**
*"In programming, the wrong time is worse than no time ‚Äî always know the source of your clock."*

---

### 19.2 The `datetime` Module ‚Äî Your Time Swiss Army Knife

* Creating date/time objects:

```python
from datetime import datetime
now = datetime.now()  
utc_now = datetime.utcnow()
```

* Breaking into components: `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `minute`, `second`.

---

### 19.3 Working with `date` and `time`

* Using `date.today()`, `date(year, month, day)`.
* Creating time-only objects with `time(hour, minute, second)`.
* Example: meeting scheduler storing only date + time separately.

---

### 19.4 Time Arithmetic with `timedelta`

* Adding/subtracting days, hours, minutes.

```python
from datetime import timedelta
tomorrow = datetime.now() + timedelta(days=1)
```

* Comparing two dates to get elapsed time.

---

### 19.5 Timestamps ‚Äî Epoch Time

* Unix timestamp basics (`time.time()`).
* Converting datetime to timestamp (`datetime.timestamp()`) and back (`datetime.fromtimestamp()`).
* Why timestamps are better for database storage.

---

### 19.6 Formatting and Parsing Dates

* `strftime` ‚Üí datetime to string.
* `strptime` ‚Üí string to datetime.

```python
now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
datetime.strptime("2025-08-03", "%Y-%m-%d")
```

* Common format codes (`%d`, `%m`, `%Y`, `%H`, `%M`, `%S`).

---

### 19.7 Time Zones and DST

* Using `zoneinfo` (Python 3.9+):

```python
from zoneinfo import ZoneInfo
ny_time = datetime.now(ZoneInfo("America/New_York"))
```

* Converting between zones.
* Handling daylight saving changes safely.

‚ö† **Warning Box:**
*"Don‚Äôt do timezone math manually ‚Äî always use a timezone-aware library."*

---

### 19.8 Measuring Performance ‚Äî `time` vs `timeit`

* `time.perf_counter()` for short intervals.
* `timeit` for accurate benchmarking:

```python
import timeit
timeit.timeit("sum(range(1000))", number=1000)
```

* Avoiding `time.sleep()` for benchmarking.

---

### 19.9 Scheduling Tasks with `sched`

* Creating a scheduler:

```python
import sched, time
scheduler = sched.scheduler(time.time, time.sleep)
scheduler.enter(5, 1, print, ("Hello after 5 seconds",))
scheduler.run()
```

* Priority scheduling.

---

### 19.10 Alternative Scheduling Approaches

* Loop-based scheduling with `while True` + `sleep`.
* External scheduling: cron (Linux), Task Scheduler (Windows).
* Async scheduling with `asyncio.sleep()`.

---

### 19.11 Real-World Applications

* Automated daily reports.
* Rate-limiting API requests.
* Reminder apps and countdown timers.

---

### 19.12 Common Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns

* Mixing naive and aware datetimes.
* Forgetting DST when scheduling future tasks.
* Using system time for measuring code performance (use monotonic time instead).

---

## üì¶ Bonus Boxes

* üìå *Under the Hood:* How Python stores datetime objects internally.
* üß™ *Mini Lab:* Build a script that prints a countdown from 10 to 0 with one-second intervals.
* ‚öôÔ∏è *Tech Tip:* Combine `zoneinfo` with database UTC storage for perfect global time handling.

---

## üß† Concept Recall

* What‚Äôs the difference between naive and aware datetimes?
* Why is UTC preferred for storage?
* How does `timeit` improve benchmarking accuracy?

---

## ‚úÖ Mastery Checklist

* [ ] I can create and manipulate datetime objects.
* [ ] I can format and parse date strings correctly.
* [ ] I can schedule tasks with `sched`.
* [ ] I know when to use monotonic time vs wall clock time.

## üßæ Cheatsheet (Chapter 19)

```python
# Current datetime
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
now = datetime.now()

# Add 1 day
tomorrow = now + timedelta(days=1)

# Format
now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

# Parse
datetime.strptime("2025-08-03", "%Y-%m-%d")

# Timezone
from zoneinfo import ZoneInfo
datetime.now(ZoneInfo("UTC"))

# Benchmark
import timeit
timeit.timeit("x = sum(range(1000))", number=1000)

# Scheduler
import sched, time
s = sched.scheduler(time.time, time.sleep)
s.enter(3, 1, print, ("Hello after 3s",))
s.run()
```

## üîó Transition to Chapter 20 ‚Äî Regex and Data Validation

Time control is essential for automation.
Next, we‚Äôll look at **pattern matching** to clean, validate, and extract meaningful data from text.
