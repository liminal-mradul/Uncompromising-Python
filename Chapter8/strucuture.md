# 📘 Chapter 8: Understanding Scope — Global, Local, and Nonlocal

> *"Scope is the invisible map of where your variables live and who can talk to them."*

---

## 🎯 Chapter Goals

By the end of this chapter, readers will be able to:

* Understand **what scope is** and why it matters in Python.
* Apply the **LEGB rule** to predict variable lookup.
* Distinguish between local, enclosing, global, and built-in scopes.
* Control variable lifetime and visibility.
* Avoid shadowing pitfalls and unintended overwrites.
* Use `global` and `nonlocal` intentionally — and know when *not* to.
* Understand how closures preserve variables from outer scopes.
* Debug and reason about variable behavior in complex code.

---

## 📂 Chapter Structure

### 8.1 What is Scope?

* Definition: the “visibility boundary” for variables.
* Real-world analogy: name tags in different rooms.
* Why scope exists — memory efficiency, name isolation.

📦 **Philosophy Box:**
*"Knowing your scope is like knowing your oxygen level while diving — ignore it, and trouble will find you."*

---

### 8.2 The LEGB Rule — Python’s Scope Hierarchy

* **Local** — inside the current function.
* **Enclosing** — outer functions in nested definitions.
* **Global** — top-level module variables.
* **Built-in** — Python’s own preloaded names.

🧪 Example:

```python
x = "global"
def outer():
    x = "enclosing"
    def inner():
        x = "local"
        print(x)
    inner()
outer()
```

---

### 8.3 Local Scope

* Created when a function starts executing.
* Destroyed when the function exits.
* Example: function parameters are local names.

⚠️ **Warning:**
*"Variables local to a function are invisible outside of it — even if they share the same name."*

---

### 8.4 Enclosing Scope

* Exists when functions are nested.
* Access from inner functions without redefining.
* The “E” in LEGB.

📦 **Pro Insight:**
*"Enclosing scope is what makes closures possible."*

---

### 8.5 Global Scope

* Variables defined at the top of a script/module.
* Accessible anywhere in that module unless shadowed.
* `global` keyword — modifying a global variable from inside a function.

⚠️ **Pitfall Box:**
*"Global variables make debugging harder — use sparingly."*

---

### 8.6 Built-in Scope

* Names Python provides by default (`len`, `range`, etc.).
* Checking built-ins with `dir(__builtins__)`.
* Why shadowing built-ins is dangerous (`list`, `dict`).

---

### 8.7 Shadowing and Name Collisions

* When a variable in one scope has the same name as another in a higher scope.
* How shadowing can break built-ins.
* Best practices to avoid accidental overrides.

---

### 8.8 Variable Lifetime

* Local variables live until function exits (or generator completes).
* Global variables live until program/module ends.
* Garbage collection and reference counting basics.

📦 **Under the Hood:**
*"Python frees memory when reference count drops to zero."*

---

### 8.9 The `global` Keyword

* Declaring a variable as global inside a function.
* When to use (rare cases like counters, caching).
* Why global state can lead to hidden dependencies.

---

### 8.10 The `nonlocal` Keyword

* Accessing variables from the nearest enclosing (non-global) scope.
* Example: counters in closures.
* How `nonlocal` differs from `global`.

🧪 Example:

```python
def outer():
    count = 0
    def inner():
        nonlocal count
        count += 1
        return count
    return inner
```

---

### 8.11 Closures and Scope Retention

* Functions remembering variables from their enclosing scope.
* Practical uses: factory functions, decorators.
* Scope chains and variable binding time.

---

### 8.12 Debugging Scope Issues

* Printing `locals()` and `globals()`.
* Using `inspect` module to see variable environments.
* Common beginner mistakes with scope.

---

### 8.13 Scope in Comprehensions and Lambdas

* Comprehension variable scope differences (Python 2 vs 3).
* Lambda capturing variables at definition time.

---

### 8.14 Scope and Performance

* Local variable access is faster than global.
* Why Python resolves names at runtime, not compile time.
* Using `nonlocal`/`global` carefully in tight loops.

---

### 8.15 Best Practices for Scope Management

* Prefer passing variables as arguments.
* Avoid mutable globals.
* Document variables that cross scopes.
* Small functions = smaller scope risk.

⚡ **Pro Insight:**
*"A small scope is a safe scope."*

* 🧪 *Mini Lab:* Write a closure-based counter with `nonlocal`.
* ⚙️ *Tech Tip:* Using `globals()` to dynamically set variables.

## 🧾 Cheatsheet (Chapter 8)

```python
# LEGB resolution example
x = "global"
def outer():
    x = "enclosing"
    def inner():
        x = "local"
        print(x)
    inner()
outer()

# global keyword
count = 0
def increment():
    global count
    count += 1

# nonlocal keyword
def make_counter():
    count = 0
    def step():
        nonlocal count
        count += 1
        return count
    return step
```
