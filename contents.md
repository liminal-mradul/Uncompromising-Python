int, float, str, bool, None, memory references, identity vs equality, dynamic typing.


4. Operators and Expressions in Depth
Arithmetic, logical, comparison, assignment chaining, short-circuiting, bitwise logic (real examples).


5. Control Flow: If, Else, Elif Patterns
Nested conditions, Pythonic branching, truthy/falsy values, pattern examples.


6. Loops and Iteration Mastery
for, while, break, continue, else clause on loops, range(), nested loops, reverse iteration.


7. Functions and Functional Thinking
Defining, calling, scope rules, default args, return values, DRY code, designing reusable functions.

24. JSON, CSV, and Web Data Interaction
Data serialization, config files, JSON APIs, CSV file automation.


25. Testing with unittest and Debugging Skills
Writing tests, test discovery, assertions, mocking, using pdb, debug logs.


26. Virtual Environments, Pip, and Package Management
venv, pip freeze, requirements.txt, publishing your own package locally.


27. Mini GUI Programming with Tkinter
Widgets, layouts, input forms, simple GUI-based apps like Notepad, calculator.


28. Networking and APIs with requests
REST API basics, GET, POST, parsing JSON from APIs, error handling in web apps.


29. Project Structure, Versioning, and Maintainability
