> *"Errors are inevitable. Crashes are optional."*

---

## üéØ Chapter Goals

By the end of this chapter, readers will:

* Understand Python‚Äôs **exception model** and error hierarchy.
* Use `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` effectively.
* Write **custom exceptions** for clearer, domain-specific error reporting.
* Decide when to **catch** vs **raise** exceptions.
* Apply **defensive programming** principles to prevent failures.
* Implement **fail-safe** and **fail-fast** strategies.
* Log, debug, and recover from errors in real-world applications.
* Optimize **exception handling performance** in large-scale code.
* Use **context managers** to write error-resilient code without manual cleanup.
* Learn from **real-world failures caused by bad error handling**.

---

## üìÇ Chapter Structure

### 13.1 The Nature of Errors

* Syntax errors vs runtime errors.
* Why exceptions exist ‚Äî *not* to hide bugs, but to handle the unexpected.
* How Python‚Äôs exception bubbling works.

üì¶ **Philosophy Box:**
*"A program that hides its errors is like a pilot who ignores warning lights."*

---

### 13.2 Python‚Äôs Exception Hierarchy

* `BaseException` ‚Üí `Exception` ‚Üí specific error classes.
* Common built-in exceptions: `ValueError`, `TypeError`, `KeyError`, `IndexError`, `FileNotFoundError`, `ZeroDivisionError`.
* `KeyboardInterrupt` and `SystemExit` ‚Äî why they‚Äôre special.

---

### 13.3 The `try` / `except` Block

```python
try:
    risky_operation()
except ValueError:
    handle_value_error()
```

* Catching specific exceptions vs a generic `except:` (and why generic is dangerous).
* Multiple `except` blocks.
* Using tuple exception handling:

```python
except (ValueError, TypeError):
    ...
```

---

### 13.4 The `else` Clause

* Runs **only** if the `try` block didn‚Äôt raise an exception.
* Useful for code that should run only on success.

```python
try:
    process_data()
except ValueError:
    print("Bad data")
else:
    print("Data processed successfully")
```

---

### 13.5 The `finally` Clause

* Always executes, success or error.
* Perfect for cleanup tasks (closing files, releasing locks).

```python
try:
    f = open("data.txt")
    ...
finally:
    f.close()
```

---

### 13.6 Raising Exceptions (`raise`)

* Raising built-in exceptions with messages.
* Creating custom exceptions:

```python
class InvalidAgeError(Exception):
    pass
```

* Chaining exceptions with `raise ... from ...`.

---

### 13.7 Catch vs Raise ‚Äî When to Do Which

* **Catch**: when you can recover or give meaningful feedback.
* **Raise**: when the calling code should decide how to handle it.
* Avoid catching and then silently passing unless absolutely necessary.

---

### 13.8 Defensive Programming Principles

* Validate inputs before processing.
* Use assertions for impossible conditions:

```python
assert speed >= 0, "Speed cannot be negative"
```

* Limit assumptions about external systems (files, network).

üì¶ **Pro Insight Box:**
*"Defensive programming isn‚Äôt about paranoia ‚Äî it‚Äôs about humility in the face of unpredictable realities."*

---

### 13.9 Logging and Error Reporting

* Using `logging` instead of `print()` for errors.
* Setting logging levels (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`).

---

### 13.10 Fail-Safe vs Fail-Fast Strategies

* **Fail-fast**: stop as soon as an error is detected (good in development).
* **Fail-safe**: continue with degraded functionality (good in production).

---

### 13.11 Common Error Handling Pitfalls

* Swallowing all exceptions (`except: pass`).
* Catching overly broad exceptions (`except Exception:` without need).
* Mixing control flow with exception handling unnecessarily.

---

### 13.12 **Performance Considerations in Exceptions**

* Raising and catching exceptions is **slower** than normal flow ‚Äî avoid using them for *expected* events.
* Prefer normal control flow for frequent conditions, exceptions for rare/unexpected events.
* Exception creation allocates traceback objects ‚Äî costly in loops.

‚ö° **Tip:**
*"If an error happens often, it‚Äôs not exceptional ‚Äî handle it with `if` instead."*

---

### 13.13 **Context Managers for Error-Safe Code**

```python
with open("data.txt") as f:
    for line in f:
        process(line)
```

* Handles file closing automatically, even if an error occurs.
* Works for database connections, network sockets, locks.
* Create your own context manager with `__enter__` and `__exit__`.

```python
class ManagedResource:
    def __enter__(self):
        print("Opening resource")
        return self
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        print("Cleaning up resource")

with ManagedResource():
    print("Using resource")
```

### 13.14 **Real-World Error Handling Disasters**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **NASA Mars Climate Orbiter (1999)**
Cause: Failure to validate units (metric vs imperial) ‚Äî cost \$327M.
Lesson: Validate *all* assumptions.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Knight Capital Trading Glitch (2012)**
Cause: Software deployed with leftover test code ‚Äî no fail-safes. Lost \$440M in 45 minutes.
Lesson: Fail-fast in financial systems; never ignore warnings.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Ariane 5 Rocket Explosion (1996)**
Cause: Unhandled integer overflow in velocity computation.
Lesson: Anticipate boundary conditions, use defensive checks.

* üìå *Tech Tip:* Use `traceback` module to log full stack traces.
* üß™ *Mini Lab:* Write a file parser that validates data and gracefully recovers from all foreseeable errors.

## üß† Concept Recall

* Why is `else` useful in exception handling?
* How do context managers help with safety?
* Why shouldn‚Äôt exceptions be used for normal flow control?

---

## ‚úÖ Mastery Checklist

* [ ] I can use `try/except/else/finally` properly.
* [ ] I can write custom exceptions.
* [ ] I can use context managers to ensure cleanup.
* [ ] I know real-world cases where error handling saved or destroyed systems.

## üßæ Cheatsheet (Chapter 13)

```python
# Basic try/except
try:
    risky()
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)

# Else and finally
try:
    process()
except ValueError:
    handle_error()
else:
    handle_success()
finally:
    cleanup()

# Raising a custom exception
class MyError(Exception):
    pass
raise MyError("Something went wrong")

# Context manager
with open("file.txt") as f:
    data = f.read()
```

---

## üîó Transition to Chapter 14 ‚Äî Modular Programming

You now know how to defend your code from collapsing under bad conditions.
Next, we‚Äôll **structure that code** into clear, maintainable modules ‚Äî
so your projects scale without becoming chaos.
