# 📘 Chapter 10: Lists and Tuples in Action

> *"If strings are the poetry of programming, lists and tuples are the raw vocabulary — they hold everything you might say."*

---

## 🎯 Chapter Goals

By the end of this chapter, readers will be able to:

* Understand what lists and tuples are and when to use each.
* Access, slice, and modify list elements.
* Create and navigate nested sequences.
* Recognize tuple immutability and its advantages.
* Apply common sequence patterns for real-world tasks.
* Use list comprehensions for clean, Pythonic data transformation.

## 📂 Chapter Structure

### 10.1 Lists vs Tuples vs Strings — The Sequence Family

| Feature       | Strings         | Lists             | Tuples             |
| ------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| Mutability    | ❌ Immutable     | ✅ Mutable         | ❌ Immutable        |
| Element Types | Characters only | Any Python object | Any Python object  |
| Syntax        | `"Hello"`       | `[1, 2, 3]`       | `(1, 2, 3)`        |
| Typical Use   | Text handling   | Data collections  | Fixed data records |

📦 **Philosophy Box:**
*"Choose lists when you expect change, tuples when you demand certainty."*

---

### 10.2 Creating Lists and Tuples

* Using literals (`[]`, `()`).
* Using `list()` and `tuple()` constructors.
* Empty lists/tuples.
* One-element tuple syntax `(42,)`.

---

### 10.3 Indexing and Slicing

* Same syntax as strings.
* Negative indexing.
* Slicing with step values.
* Slicing returns a **new list/tuple** — original unchanged.

🧪 Example:

```python
nums = [10, 20, 30, 40]
print(nums[1:3])  # [20, 30]
```

---

### 10.4 Nesting Sequences

* Lists inside lists.
* Tuples inside lists, and vice versa.
* Accessing deeply nested elements (`matrix[1][2]`).
* Mini matrix example.

---

### 10.5 Modifying Lists (Mutability in Action)

* Assigning to an index.
* Replacing slices with new values.
* Adding items: `.append()`, `.extend()`, `+`.
* Inserting with `.insert()`.
* Removing with `.remove()`, `.pop()`, `del`.

⚠️ **Common Pitfall:**
Changing a list while iterating over it.

---

### 10.6 Tuple Immutability

* Attempting to change tuple → `TypeError`.
* Why immutability matters (safety, dictionary keys, set members).
* Tuples can contain mutable objects.

📦 **Under the Hood:**
*"Tuples store references — immutability applies to structure, not content."*

---

### 10.7 Common Patterns with Lists and Tuples

* Membership tests (`in`, `not in`).
* Concatenation and repetition.
* Unpacking into variables.
* Swapping variables without a temp (`a, b = b, a`).

---

### 10.8 Iterating over Lists and Tuples

* Simple `for` loops.
* `enumerate()` for index + value.
* Nested iteration for 2D lists.

---

### 10.9 List Comprehension Basics

* Syntax: `[expression for item in iterable if condition]`.
* Filtering data in one line.
* Nested comprehensions for matrix flattening.
* Comparison to `map()` and `filter()`.

🧪 Example:

```python
squares = [x*x for x in range(1, 6)]
```

---

### 10.10 Practical Mini-Applications

* Storing and sorting student grades.
* Removing duplicates with `set()`.
* Zipping lists for paired data processing.

---

### 10.11 Performance Considerations

* Tuples are slightly faster than lists.
* When to choose one over the other for large datasets.

---

## 📦 Bonus Boxes

* 📌 *Tech Tip:* Use tuple unpacking for cleaner returns from functions.
* 🧪 *Mini Lab:* Build a simple to-do list manager with `append()` and `pop()`.
* ⚙️ *Under the Hood:* How Python stores list capacity and grows dynamically.

## 🧾 Cheatsheet (Chapter 10)

```python
# Create
nums = [1, 2, 3]
point = (10, 20)

# Modify list
nums.append(4)
nums[1] = 99

# Tuple unpacking
x, y = point

# List comprehension
evens = [n for n in nums if n % 2 == 0]
```

## 🔗 Transition to Part II — From Basics to Control

With lists and tuples mastered, you now have **containers** that hold almost any type of data.
In Part II, we’ll begin shaping **how data flows** through your programs — starting with **dictionaries and sets**, where relationships and uniqueness become your new tools.
